# [[Contributor Guidelines]]

Welcome to the Excalidraw Plugin Wiki! I'm excited to have you contribute to our community-driven documentation.

## General Guidelines

1. **Be Respectful**: Approach contributions with respect and consideration for existing content and fellow contributors.
2. **Follow Existing Format**: Adhere to the current formatting and structure of the wiki to maintain consistency. Review the [[Proposed Content Structure and File Naming Conventions]].
3. **Use Clear Language**: Write clearly and concisely. Avoid jargon unless it is necessary and defined.
4. **Proofread Your Contributions**: Review your changes for typos and grammatical errors before submitting. Pro Tip: Ask ChatGPT to review your updates.

## Contribution Process

You have two ways to contribute to the wiki. Choose the option that works best for you.

### 1. Quick Contribution via GitHub Issue (Recommended for Most Contributors)
For a simpler way to contribute:
- [Click here to open a new issue](https://github.com/zsviczian/excalidraw-wiki/issues/new?assignees=&labels=contribution&projects=&template=wiki-contribution.yaml&title=New+Wiki+Page+Contribution%3A+%5BPAGE+TITLE%5D) to suggest a new page or an edit.
- In the issue, specify:
  - The **folder** and **title** for the page based on the current wiki structure.
  - Your content for the page (including links to existing wiki topics as `[[Wiki links]]` to ensure smooth integration).
  - Attach any relevant **screenshots** (use Obsidian base theme in light mode).
  - Include **code blocks**, if applicable.
- Once the issue is submitted, either I or one of the wiki editors will copy the content into the Obsidian vault and publish it.

### 2. Fork and Clone (For More Advanced Contributors)

Here's a more detailed [[How-to contribute to the Wiki  (Step-by-Step)]] documentation to help you in case you get lost.

If you are familiar with Git and prefer a more hands-on approach:
1. **Fork and Clone the Vault**: Fork the [Excalidraw-Wiki repository](https://github.com/zsviczian/excalidraw-wiki) on GitHub and clone it to your local device. This will give you a local copy of the Obsidian vault to work on.
2. **Verify Your Changes**: Review your changes and additions to ensure they are accurate and meet the guidelines.
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you're satisfied with your changes, submit a pull request (PR) with a clear description of what youâ€™ve done. Reference any relevant issues or discussions.

## Major Changes and Discussions

1. **Discuss Major Changes**: If you are planning major changes or are unsure about how to proceed, I recommend opening a discussion first. This helps ensure that your changes are well-considered and aligned with the overall direction of the documentation.
2. **Seek Feedback**: Use discussions to seek feedback or clarification before modifying content, especially for complex or impactful changes.

## Content-Specific Guidelines

1. **Accuracy**: Ensure that all information you add or modify is accurate and up-to-date.
2. **Screenshots**: Include screenshots where they help clarify or illustrate changes, particularly for UI-related content.
3. **References**: Provide sources or references when introducing new or specific information.
