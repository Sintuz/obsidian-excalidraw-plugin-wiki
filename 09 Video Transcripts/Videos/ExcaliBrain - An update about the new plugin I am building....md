So hey everyone, I wanted to give you a quick update on what I've been busy with. [* ](https://youtu.be/O2s-h5VKCas?t=0) Over the last couple of days, I've been building a proper plugin for the Excalidraw brain experience. I call it Excalibrain, and let me show you what I have today. [* ](https://youtu.be/O2s-h5VKCas?t=6) It's not quite ready to be released, but I'm extremely excited about the opportunities that this plugin is creating for my knowledge workflow. [* ](https://youtu.be/O2s-h5VKCas?t=20)

Let me just navigate you around. This is my YouTube channel mock, and if I click on Circle Map, one thing you can already notice is that the maps load much quicker. [* ](https://youtu.be/O2s-h5VKCas?t=32) So when I click, it immediately opens up, and you can see I can navigate my brain or my vault without any issues. [* ](https://youtu.be/O2s-h5VKCas?t=44) Now let's say I come to this thought right here: Excalidraw versus iMindMap, and I want to know if I have an iMindMap thought in my brain. So I start to type "iMindMap," and there you go! I have iMindMap HD; I already have that thought in my brain. [* ](https://youtu.be/O2s-h5VKCas?t=55)

So I want to link this to my drawing right here. What do I do? I open iMindMap HD, I've navigated to this page, and now I'm going to add a jump. [* ](https://youtu.be/O2s-h5VKCas?t=78) I'm going to jump that to Excalidraw versus iMindMap HD. Now, what you can also notice is that the Excalibrain plugin automatically recognizes that I've added a link. [* ](https://youtu.be/O2s-h5VKCas?t=91) If I navigate back to my Excalidraw versus iMindMap, then it just shows me the jump relationship between the two. [* ](https://youtu.be/O2s-h5VKCas?t=112)

I think beyond the search here and also this real-time update, I'm also very excited. I spent an enormous amount of time, and I still have lots of work to do. [* ](https://youtu.be/O2s-h5VKCas?t=127) I spent lots of time on the settings and just want to show you that now you can properly select colors and just change the opacity, etc. [* ](https://youtu.be/O2s-h5VKCas?t=141) This plugin is going to have a very slick set of settings where you can fully customize the way the map looks. [* ](https://youtu.be/O2s-h5VKCas?t=150)

You'll have all sorts of settings like displaying inferred relations or only explicitly defined relations, showing attachments or not, and showing virtual child notes or not. [* ](https://youtu.be/O2s-h5VKCas?t=161) All sorts of settings will make this highly configurable. [* ](https://youtu.be/O2s-h5VKCas?t=177) Overall, this is what I wanted to show you. I think this is just simply very exciting, and I'm extremely happy about this. [* ](https://youtu.be/O2s-h5VKCas?t=183)

And again, just navigating around here to show you the speed at which this tool is able to navigate. Right now, I'm really, really excited about the speed and the way the look and feel. [* ](https://youtu.be/O2s-h5VKCas?t=190) Overall, I hope you're going to love this plugin as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/O2s-h5VKCas?t=211) Thank you!
