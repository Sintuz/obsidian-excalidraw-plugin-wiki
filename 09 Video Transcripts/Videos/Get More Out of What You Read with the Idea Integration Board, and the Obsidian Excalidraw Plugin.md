# Summary
In this video, Zsolt introduces his innovative "Idea Integration Board," a method designed to enhance the reading and understanding of books through visual note-taking. He explains his organized approach to creating folders for each book, which contain various types of notes and summaries, and demonstrates how he applies these techniques to enrich his learning process. Additionally, Zsolt emphasizes the importance of mapping primary concepts and integrating various media to create a comprehensive understanding of the material.

# Key Takeaways
- The "Idea Integration Board" helps capture and organize thoughts and concepts from books using visual methods.
- Each book is stored in a dedicated folder that includes literature notes, summaries, and illustrations.
- Mapping primary ideas and connecting them with secondary and peripheral concepts enhances understanding and retention of the material.

Hey everyone, Jol here! Over the past four or five years, I've developed a process for reading a book, capturing electronic notes, and creating visual book-on-a-page summaries. Each time I pick up a book, I reflect on my process and look for ways to improve on it, ensuring that with each iteration, the process is slightly better and different. Today, I want to show you my latest innovation: the Idea Integration Board for a book. But before we jump into that, I want to give you a high-level view of my process and explain how the Idea Integration Board evolved and what problem I aim to solve with this idea. Each time I encounter a new book, I create a folder for it under my "Input Books" folder. I do this because a book typically has multiple files, and by default, there are four files for each book: a cover page or research page, my literature notes, my summary, and my book-on-a-page. The reason I have a folder is that as I start to create my illustrations, I end up with tons of files related to that book, and I want to capture all of them in one place. [* ](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=0)

My research page for the book typically looks something like this: I have basic data about the book, a high-level summary‚Äîin the case of "The Extended Mind," I only have a simple image‚Äîand a couple of links: links to my literature notes, my book-on-a-page, and my summary. Below that, I have the notes I take during the reading and research process. You can see the different aspects that I've captured about the book: videos I've watched, etc., all in one place. This is my research work. This article discusses how you can improve your understanding of what you're reading and the various levels of understanding. One key idea that I want to highlight is the concept of first mapping out the primary ideas in the book and then building secondary ideas around those primary concepts, eventually linking peripheral ideas to the secondary ones. By mapping out the primary ideas, you create a foundation upon which you can build your understanding of the book. This method is effective for technical and business books but not as applicable to fiction. [* ](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=45)

The first time I applied the idea of mapping out primary ideas was while reading "Rationality" in cohort 4 of the Visual Thinking Workshop. I found that the way Eliezer Yudkowsky presented the material didn't resonate with me, so I ended up reading chapter 1 three or four times and creating a concept map to better understand the initial concepts. This sparked the idea I later experimented with while reading "Finite and Infinite Games" in cohort 5, where I decided to create a mind map‚Äîan Idea Integration Board‚Äîrather than following my traditional note-taking method. In the case of "Finite and Infinite Games," I captured relevant reading materials, internet resources, and my literature notes there. This approach allowed me to organize my thoughts around the primary ideas or maps that highlighted important dualities and contrasts presented in the book. Now, I‚Äôm building on this approach as I move into the next book, "Playing to Win," for cohort 6 of the Visual Thinking Workshop. [* ](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=90)

Today, I started reading "Playing to Win" in preparation for the cohort kickoff on Saturday. Let me walk you through the different elements of my Idea Integration Board for this book. At the center, you can see the book itself. In the introduction, there is a reference to three thinkers and three models. I had previously gathered materials about all three of these models in my vault, so I created links that connect to the relevant content. For example, I have information about Porter's Five Forces, and I even have a draft of a blog post that I haven't published. On the right side, as I began reading the book, I looked at the table of contents, which is a standard practice when starting a new book. The table of contents lays out the primary ideas in the book, and I noticed that the central five chapters focus on the five choices of strategy, with additional material to provide context. This basic structure of the book helps guide my understanding as I delve into the chapters. [* ](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=135)

While reading, I noted the mention of a "Cascade of Choices" in the chapter on strategy as choice, prompting me to create a drawing for myself, which I plan to expand as I read further. My practice during reading is also to conduct research; this includes exploring blog posts, watching YouTube videos, and listening to podcasts. For instance, I watched an interview at the Milken Institute, which highlighted the key ideas from the book. I captured my notes from that discussion, embedding them in my Idea Integration Board. They are sourced from my input folder and can be accessed later. When I navigate to my YouTube section, I find there the video related to "Playing to Win." [* ](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=210)

I also linked to a few other books I have read and have in my vault that relate to the themes discussed in "Playing to Win." These include "First Things First" by Stephen Covey, "Worldly Wisdom," and "The Infinite Game" by Simon Sinek. Although I haven't explored the connections yet, I believe that they may have relevant insights. On my Idea Board, I'm currently adding my book notes; my literature notes are still empty because I'm reading on my Kindle and haven't imported them into Obsidian yet. I also have two other pages that are just links for now, but when the time comes, I'll click on them to create my summary and book-on-a-page notes. [* ](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=300)

If we look under the hood, when I switch to markdown view, you‚Äôll see that my Excalidraw drawing is similar to my notes on "The Extended Mind." Here you see my header, links, and a few notes from the past that I imported, which date back at least five years, indicating that I had looked at this book previously. Below, I have my Excalidraw contents. If you're curious to learn more about the idea of flipping the page and reviewing the back side of the drawing, I recommend checking out my video about visual thinking. That's the idea I wanted to share with you today. If you're interested, the Visual Thinking Workshop cohort 6 starts this Saturday, and there‚Äôs still time to join us! In this workshop, we‚Äôll read "Playing to Win" and follow a six-step process that includes reading the book, creating literature notes, capturing sketches, compiling our book-on-a-page summary, saving visual permanent notes into our Zettelkasten system, and finally presenting our books on a page to each other. Thank you! [* ](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=375)

across](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=52) [a book I create a folder for that book](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=55) [under my input books](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=58) [folder I create a folder because for me](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=62) [a book typically has multiple files by](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=66) [default there are four files for

notes my summary and my book](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=79) [on a page but the reason I have a folder](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=81) [is because as I start to create my](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=84) [illustrations you can see that I am end](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=87) [up with tons and tons of files related](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=90) [to that book and I want to capture them](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=93) [in one folder now my research page for](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=96) [the book and this is where the ID](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=100) [integration board will come in so this](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=102) [is what we're going to focus on now my](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=104) [research page typically looks something](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=107) [like this I have some basic data about](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=109) [the book I typically have some

[have couple of links links to the](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=122) [literature notes links to my book on a](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=124) [page and to my summary and below that I](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=128) [have notes that I take during the](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=131) [process of reading and doing research so](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=135) [you can see the](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=138) [different aspects that I've captured](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=140) [about the book videos I watched](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=143) [Etc all in one page this is my research](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=146) [work this article talks about how you](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=151) [can improve your understanding of what](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=154) [you're reading and what are different](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=157) [levels of understanding and the concept](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=159) [I want to highlight is this concept that](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=161) [focuses on first mapping out the primary](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=165) [ideas in the book then building the](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=169) [secondary ideas around those primary](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=173) [ideas and finally linking the periph](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=176) [iial ideas in the book to the secondary](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=179) [ideas and in a by mapping out the](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=183) [primary ideas this becomes sort of the](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=186) [foundation on which you can build your](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=189) [understanding of the book now of course](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=192) [this applies to technical books to](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=194) [business books not so much to](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=196) [fiction the first time I applied this](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=200) [idea of mapping out primary ideas was](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=203) [that I was reading rational ity in](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=207) [cohort 4 of the visual thinking workshop](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=210) [and somehow the way elazer yut kovski](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=214) [presented the material just didn't click](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=218) [with me at all so I ended up reading](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=220) [chapter 1 at least three four times and](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=224) [creating this concept map for myself so](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=227) [I can better understand what the book is](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=231) [about or better understand the initial](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=234) [concept and this is what triggered the](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=237) [idea that then I experimented in or](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=239) [experimented with while reading finite](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=243) [and infinite games in cohort 5 that I](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=246) [should really create a mind map an idea](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=250) [integration board for the book instead](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=254) [of following my old style method of](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=257) [creating a markdown note with all my](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=261) [research so in case of finite and](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=264) [infinite games I created this board](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=266) [there I captured some of the relevant](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=270) [other reading I captured some Internet](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=273) [Resources I also captured my literature](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=277) [notes here so I still have a literature](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=280) [notes file and I keep all my highlights](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=283) [and my drawings in here as well as for](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=287) [me this primary ideas or map was this](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=291) [list of uh dualities and cont conts that](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=296) [were presented in finite and infinite](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=300) [games and now this is what I'm building](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=303) [on in the next book that we're going to](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=307) [be reading in cohort 6 of the visual](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=310) [thinking Workshop playing to win and](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=313) [today I started to read playing to win](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=316) [in preparation for the cohort kickoff on](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=319) [Saturday and this is how my playing to](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=322) [Vin idea integration board looks like](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=326) [today and let me just quickly walk you](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=330) [through the different elements of it](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=332) [then show you a little bit what's under](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=335) [the hood so of course here at the center](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=337) [you can see the book itself in the intro](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=341) [there's reference to three thinkers](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=345) [three models and I happened to have](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=348) [materials about all of these three](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=353) [models in My Vault so these are actually](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=355) [links that will take you to the relevant](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=358) [material and for example here's the](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=361) [porter five forces and I even have a](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=364) [blog post which I think I never posted](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=368) [actually but I have a draft and I have](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=371) [some written material on it then on the](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=373) [right hand side as I started to read the](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=377) [book before I jumped in to read the book](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=380) [I looked at the table of contents](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=383) [because that's always a good practice](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=385) [when you read a book first first look at](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=388) [the table of contents and understand the](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=390) [map of the territory typically the table](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=393) [of contents give you gives you the](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=395) [primary ideas in the book and as I was](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=398) [reading the introduction chapter I](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=401) [notice that the central five chapters](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=405) [are actually the five choices of](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=410) [strategy and then there are](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=413) [some material before and after it](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=416) [to place it into context but this is the](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=419) [basic structure of the book and as I'm](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=423) [going to be reading this right now I was](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=425) [reading the chapter today that strategy](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=428) [is choice and there's this mention of](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=431) [this Cascade of choices so I created](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=434) [this drawing for myself I'm going to add](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=437) [additional drawings here and notes as I](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=440) [read about this but also my practice is](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=443) [that when I'm reading a book I like to](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=447) [do some research and for me research](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=449) [means reading blog posts looking at](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=452) [YouTube videos as well as listening to](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=455) [podcasts so I was also watching this](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=459) [video by the Milken Institute this is](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=463) [actually an interview between Ag and](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=466) [Roger and they talk about the key ideas](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=470) [in the book so I actually captured my](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=474) [notes here you can see that this is an](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=476) [embedded note because my notes on videos](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=481) [on articles they go into my input folder](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=485) [to a different section so I can show you](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=488) [where this leads to if now I close my](https://youtu.be/Lq2ZKDF9gOQ?t=491) [books section and come down to
