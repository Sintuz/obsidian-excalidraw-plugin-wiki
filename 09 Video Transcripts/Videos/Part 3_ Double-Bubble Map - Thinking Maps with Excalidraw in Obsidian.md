![Part 3: Double-Bubble Map - Thinking Maps with Excalidraw in Obsidian](https://youtu.be/Hm4En13TDjs)

# Summary
In this video, the presenter introduces the Double-Bubble Map as a powerful thinking tool for comparing and contrasting concepts. Using popular personal knowledge management (PKM) tools, Roam and Obsidian, he highlights their similarities and differences. The video emphasizes the versatility of visual thinking maps, such as mind maps and concept maps, in enhancing understanding and creativity.

# Key Takeaways
- The Double-Bubble Map is effective for comparing and contrasting two ideas or concepts.
- Roam and Obsidian, while both PKM tools, differ fundamentally in data storage and functionality, such as the use of queries and community plugins.
- Mind maps encourage creative thinking, whereas concept maps aid in understanding complex relationships.

Use the Double-Bubble Map to compare and contrast things. Let's compare and contrast two popular PKM tools: Roam and Obsidian. How would you compare Roam to Obsidian? Notice how I use the Obsidian icon from the stencil library and copy and paste the Roam astrolabe image from the web to use as the other central idea. [* ](https://youtu.be/Hm4En13TDjs?t=10)

Well, they both support markdown, but Obsidian stores information in files in a folder on your computer, while Roam has a datomic graph database under the hood. They both manage forward and backlinks between nodes. Roam has a native query language to interrogate your data, while for Obsidian, you need to install the Dataview plugin to achieve something comparable. [* ](https://youtu.be/Hm4En13TDjs?t=30)

Since the release of Obsidian 13, both Obsidian and Roam provide a quasi "what you see is what you get" editor experience. Obsidian stores your information locally, while Roam stores information in the cloud. Both tools have a very active and friendly community. Obsidian is free, but Roam is subscription-based. [* ](https://youtu.be/Hm4En13TDjs?t=60)

They can both be extended by installing plugins, but Obsidian has a community plugin store while Roam does not. You can create block-level references in both; however, in Roam, block references come more naturally because your data is physically stored in the database at the block level, while Obsidian stores your data at the document level. [* ](https://youtu.be/Hm4En13TDjs?t=90)

Here's another example: let's explore the similarities and differences between mind maps and concept maps. They both use simple circles, rectangles, and lines. They both facilitate visual thinking, can be used in a group or alone, and are very versatile, being applicable in almost any domain. [* ](https://youtu.be/Hm4En13TDjs?t=116)

A concept map shows relationships among sub-concepts relating to one main concept, while a mind map shows sub-topics of a domain in a creative and seamless manner. Concept maps facilitate reflective thinking, and mind maps trigger creative thinking. Mind maps are free-flowing and fast, while concept maps are more restricted by formal rules and take more time to create. [* ](https://youtu.be/Hm4En13TDjs?t=140)

You read a mind map center out and a concept map top down or left to right. Through the double encoding approach, mind maps help memorization while concept maps are great for understanding complex concepts quickly. [* ](https://youtu.be/Hm4En13TDjs?t=180)

As you can see, Double-Bubble Maps are great for exploring the similarities and differences between ideas and things. This concludes the introduction of the Double-Bubble Map. In the next video, I will cover three maps. Don't forget to subscribe so you're notified when part 4 is released. Thank you for watching. [* ](https://youtu.be/Hm4En13TDjs?t=200)
