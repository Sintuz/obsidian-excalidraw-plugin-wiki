![Develop the Superpower of Constructive Debating with Dialog Mapping - includes ChatGPT case study](https://youtu.be/q1r-_Df-Q34)

# Summary
In this video, the speaker introduces the concept of dialog mapping based on the Ibis methodology, a tool designed to enhance constructive debating and improve decision-making. By providing a structured approach to discussions, Ibis helps participants organize their thoughts and navigate complex issues, making it valuable for both business teams and students alike. The video also features a case study involving a debate on the impact of ChatGPT, illustrating the effectiveness of dialog mapping in analyzing arguments.

# Key Takeaways
- Dialog mapping is a powerful technique that enhances constructive debating by structuring arguments and ideas.
- The Ibis methodology includes three basic elements: questions, ideas, and arguments, which lead to a visual representation of discussions.
- Using dialog mapping can improve decision-making and help individuals navigate complex problems in various contexts, including academic and professional settings.

Hey everyone, have you ever found yourself in a heated debate and lost track of all the arguments being thrown around? I know I have. Sometimes it can be tough to keep up with complex topics, especially when everyone has their own opinions, and let's be real, we all tend to favor the arguments of people we agree with, right? [* ](https://youtu.be/q1r-_Df-Q34?t=0)

Well, what if I told you that there's a superpower that you can develop that will make you a pro at constructive debating? It's called dialog mapping, and it's based on the issue-based information system (IBIS) methodology. With IBIS, you can tackle even the toughest problems, from wicked issues to wicked mass and beyond. [* ](https://youtu.be/q1r-_Df-Q34?t=27)

As someone who's worked in big corporations for over two decades, I know firsthand that we often have to work in teams to solve complex problems, and let's face it, sometimes it's tough to communicate effectively when there are so many factors to consider. That's where IBIS dialog mapping comes in. It gives you a structured framework for discussing issues and helps you identify key points and clarify your positions. This leads to more productive conversations and better decision-making. [* ](https://youtu.be/q1r-_Df-Q34?t=45)

But it's not just for business; as a student, you can use IBIS to tackle tough assignments and complex subjects. It can help you organize your thoughts, identify key issues, and explore different perspectives. Ultimately, it can lead to better ideas and a deeper understanding of the subject matter. [* ](https://youtu.be/q1r-_Df-Q34?t=87)

As a visual thinker and personal knowledge management enthusiast, IBIS has been a game changer for me. It encourages me to ask probing questions and consider different viewpoints, which leads to a more well-rounded understanding of complex problems. [* ](https://youtu.be/q1r-_Df-Q34?t=119)

So how does IBIS mapping work? It's simple, really. There are three basic elements: questions, which pose a problem or an issue; ideas, which offer possible solutions or explanations; and arguments, which state evidence, facts, and viewpoints that either support or object to ideas. [* ](https://youtu.be/q1r-_Df-Q34?t=131)

There are three simple rules to follow as well. Maps always start with a question node; arguments may not link to a question directly, and questions may be about any IBIS element. Participants start with an issue articulated as an open question and then ask and answer questions to explore the issue and its potential solutions. The resulting diagram is a visual representation of the conversation, which can be referred back to and built upon in the future. [* ](https://youtu.be/q1r-_Df-Q34?t=159)

To give you a better idea of how IBIS works, I mapped out the first 10 minutes of a debate from Intelligent Squared US titled "Will ChatGPT do more harm than good?" If you're not familiar with this podcast, I highly recommend checking it out. They usually cover current topics, and just by listening to these conversations, you can develop an appreciation for constructive arguments. [* ](https://youtu.be/q1r-_Df-Q34?t=194)

The debate was moderated by John Donvan, with Gary Marcus, the author of "Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust," arguing for the motion that ChatGPT will do more harm than good. In contrast, the entrepreneur, author, and CEO of Signore Rank Corporation argued against the motion, claiming that ChatGPT will do more good than harm. [* ](https://youtu.be/q1r-_Df-Q34?t=228)

Gary opened his argument by claiming that ChatGPT hallucinates and makes things up all the time, including quotes from people and scientific articles. He cited how Google's market cap fell on February 8th when Google's AI flopped in an advertisement as evidence. Gary then explained why he believes that ChatGPT poses a clear and present danger; it can be used to create misinformation at scale, which will be misused by bad actors and eventually undermine trust in society. [* ](https://youtu.be/q1r-_Df-Q34?t=238)

He argued that current guardrails are not sufficient and presented three additional pieces of evidence to support his claims, referencing the Russian propaganda machine researched by Steven Pinker, who used ChatGPT for research and found that quotes were made up upon fact-checking. He also mentioned CNET, which recently published large volumes of AI-generated articles containing erroneous information. He closed his opening argument with the claim that ChatGPT is prone to giving bad medical advice, supported by evidence that in early experiments, GPT-3 was known to have counseled suicide in some cases. [* ](https://youtu.be/q1r-_Df-Q34?t=264)

Keith started his discussion by exploring the question of what it means that ChatGPT is a large language model. He explained how ChatGPT is similar to Wikipedia but with a natural language interface that is better to interact with. He compared ChatGPT to a librarian or a research assistant. His key conclusion was that when evaluating ChatGPT's contribution to the world, it must be judged by the criterion of being a powerful retrieval engine with a natural language interface and not as AI, which it is not. [* ](https://youtu.be/q1r-_Df-Q34?t=345)

He went on to explore what ChatGPT is good at, including designing logic flows, writing computer code, recommending strategies for solving life challenges, and accessing and retrieving data. He supported his claim about life strategies with an anecdote about his son’s girlfriend using ChatGPT to suggest strategies for dealing with a disinterested student in her class. He conceded that ChatGPT gets confused when asked to compare historical figures like Locke and Hume. [* ](https://youtu.be/q1r-_Df-Q34?t=390)

He concluded his argument by advocating that on the whole, ChatGPT's contribution to the world is as positive as the internet, and that comparing ChatGPT to AI is the wrong framing; comparing it to a research assistant would be more appropriate. [* ](https://youtu.be/q1r-_Df-Q34?t=427)

For the sake of time, I will stop my summary of the conversation here, but hopefully, this has given you a good flavor of how dialogue mapping works. I did actually map the whole conversation, and as you can see, the red counterarguments are all over the map. Gary and Keith went into challenging each other’s arguments. If you're interested, follow the link in the show notes and give this debate a listen. [* ](https://youtu.be/q1r-_Df-Q34?t=442)

In conclusion, IBIS dialog mapping provides a structured way to explore complex issues and ideas. So if you ever face a complex problem, give IBIS dialogue mapping a try; it might just be the tool you need to unlock your thinking and reach a better solution. Trust me, it's like having a superpower. [* ](https://youtu.be/q1r-_Df-Q34?t=472)

Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/q1r-_Df-Q34?t=497)

In this video, I introduce the concept of dialog mapping with the Issue-Based Information System (IBIS) methodology. Dialog mapping provides a structured framework for discussing complex topics and helps identify key points while clarifying positions. I explain the three basic elements of IBIS: Questions, Ideas, and Arguments, and provide simple rules to follow when creating maps. I then demonstrate how dialog mapping works by mapping the first 10 minutes of a debate from the Intelligence Squared US podcast titled "Will ChatGPT do more harm than good?".
