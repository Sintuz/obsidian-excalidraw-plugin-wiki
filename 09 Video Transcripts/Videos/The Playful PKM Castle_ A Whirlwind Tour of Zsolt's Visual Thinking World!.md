Hey there, very knowledge seekers! My name is Jolt. Do you ever feel tired of reading long texts and writing lists? Do you ever feel like PKM and learning is a dull affair? Well, buckle up because I'm about to take you on a journey through my Visual PKM Castle, where playfulness meets knowledge. Welcome to the world of playful PKM‚Äîyour treasure map to Jolt's visual PKM! In this castle, each room is bursting with treasures of wisdom, all framed up in the rooms of my YouTube playlists. [* ](https://youtu.be/X0AmZGQ_7z4?t=0)

Our first stop is PKM and Obsidian! Dive into organizing your notes, explore Zettelkasten, glide through PKM workflows, get my take on some of Obsidian's features, and explore topics such as the mind-blowing map view where your notes come alive based on geolocation tags. Now, let's step into the Visual Thinking Chamber! Immerse yourself in the magic of the thinking maps, connect ideas through images, clarify your thinking with dialogue mapping and flowcharts, and get hands-on with spatial thinking. Explore my creative approach to daily journaling, work on strategy and road maps, and navigate your notes with fantasy maps of content and other videos, such as image occlusion for learning. We've got it all! [* ](https://youtu.be/X0AmZGQ_7z4?t=39)

But that's not all! Get ready for a splash of color in the Illustration Gallery. Master color palettes, embrace AI art generators like Mouri, and learn the art of "cheating" in drawing. Explore the seven steps of creating concept visuals, and uncover the secrets of the golden spiral like books. I'm not surprised it's time to flip through my book on a page videos‚Äîdiscover bops with worksheets, delve into how to take smart notes and build a second brain, and explore philosophy and other popular productivity and self-help books. Witness the showdown of Excalidraw versus Obsidian Canvas when it comes to presenting "Book on a Page" summaries, and finally, learn the ropes of creating your own "Book on a Page" masterpieces. [* ](https://youtu.be/X0AmZGQ_7z4?t=126)

Now, let's sprint through feature walkthroughs with over 70 videos! I won't cover them all today, but you might be interested in my "How to Get Started" videos, Excalidraw AI support templates, mermaid diagrams, and my feature walkthrough series, which is slightly outdated but still timely. Don't forget the fascinating role of linking notes via images; I know this was just a quick tease‚Äîit's a treasure trove of Obsidian Excalidraw magic! But that is not all‚Äîfar from it! Unlock the secrets of Excalibrain, learn to navigate Obsidian with finesse, and master the art of connecting ideas. It's your guide to making the most of Obsidian's powerful capabilities and your priceless notes carefully stored in your vault. [* ](https://youtu.be/X0AmZGQ_7z4?t=161)

Behold the Excalibrain Script Library‚Äîa superpower for Obsidian Excalibdraw enthusiasts! Explore nearly 100 scripts, including the slideshow script I'm using right now that transforms your Excalidraw into a parallax navigation. This is where programming meets creativity, and it almost literally has no limits! Explore some showcase videos to get a sense of the art of the possible. Want to go deeper? Interested in technical visual PKM? Venture into the scripting chamber where programming and creativity collide, from recent automation examples to timeless programming approaches. It's a heaven for those looking to delve into the world of Excalidraw and Obsidian scripting. [* ](https://youtu.be/X0AmZGQ_7z4?t=197)
