![Obsidian-Excalidraw 1.2.0 Walkthrough Part 2/10: Basic shapes and features](https://youtu.be/Iy_oVTq12Gw)

# Summary
In this video, the presenter walks viewers through the essential features and basic shapes of the Excalidraw tool within Obsidian. Key functionalities discussed include creating shapes, using the grid system, adjusting colors, and manipulating lines and arrows. The tutorial aims to provide a foundational understanding of Excalidraw, ensuring users can effectively utilize its features for visual note-taking.

# Key Takeaways
- Excalidraw provides a palette of basic shapes, including boxes and circles, which can be manipulated using keyboard shortcuts.
- The grid feature allows for precise alignment of objects, while color and stroke options enhance visual customization.
- Users can create connected objects with arrows that bend and move together, as well as adjust font styles and placements.

Hey, welcome back, and this is part two [* ](https://youtu.be/Iy_oVTq12Gw) talking about native Excalidraw features, looking at the basic shapes in Excalidraw. So let's just get started and create a new empty drawing [* ](https://youtu.be/Iy_oVTq12Gw). I'm just going to show you some of the basic features here. So first of all, you have this palette of different shapes, and if I choose a box, then I can draw a box. If I hit Shift, then I get a square. The same with a circle: if I just drag the circle, then I get all sorts of ellipses. If I hit Shift, then I can draw a perfect circle [* ](https://youtu.be/Iy_oVTq12Gw).

There's the lock button, which is quite helpful. So if there's a shape and you want to draw more of those shapes, for example, if you want a bunch of arrows, then if you hit lock, you can actually continue to draw the same shape multiple times. There's also a trick that if you hit Alt and click on an image, you can create a copy, and this also works for a complex shape. So if I have all of these selected and hold down the Alt key and then drag, I can create a copy of these selected items [* ](https://youtu.be/Iy_oVTq12Gw).

Right now, I have the grid turned on; this is how my template looks, but I can come here and turn off the grid. If I don't have the grid, I can freely move the objects around. If I have the grid, then it will actually snap to the grid so you can see that it only stops at certain positions. There are some colors here, so I can first of all change the mode; this is now the dark mode. I can change to light mode, and I can also change the background color if I want a different background. I can also simply type in colors, and I'm going to get those colors like this, but I can also put in the normal RGB hexadecimal colors as well [* ](https://youtu.be/Iy_oVTq12Gw).

If I select the shape, I can change the stroke color as well as change the fill color for the shape. There are different fill effects that you can choose or different fill patterns, and this is all quite self-explanatory. In terms of lines and arrows, there are some common features. Let me just put here a line as well. If I double-click on a shape, either an arrow or a line, then I can see these control points, and if I hold down Alt and click, then I can actually add additional points to my shape [* ](https://youtu.be/Iy_oVTq12Gw).

I can also change the edges, so the edges can be sharp or they can be round. The special feature of lines is that you can close them into a shape in which case they get filled. The special feature of arrows is you can attach them to objects, and if you attach them to objects, then as you move the object, the arrow will move as well. If you have an arrow that has a breakpoint, let me put this breakpoint right here and let me just attach this part of the arrow here. I'll move this point to the middle. Now if I move the object, you can see that the object is going to bend at the breakpoint, or if I make this a sharp edge, then you can see that it is going to turn that edge sharp [* ](https://youtu.be/Iy_oVTq12Gw).

Also, Excalidraw offers fonts. There are three font faces: there's this handwritten font that looks like this. You can choose the font; you can set the font size, or you can choose predefined font sizes as well as do some text alignment to align the text to the right or to the left. This makes more sense when you have multiple lines of text, and you can see here how my text is adjusted to the right side in this case. The other font types include the normal font and include the coding font type as well, so these are the three font types you have, and that's about it about the very basic features of Excalidraw [* ](https://youtu.be/Iy_oVTq12Gw).
