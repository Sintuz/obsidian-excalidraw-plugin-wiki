![Which Obsidian-Excalidraw release channel is the right for you?](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt explains the updated release channels for the Obsidian Excalidraw plugin, aiming to alleviate the concerns of users experiencing change fatigue due to frequent updates. He introduces a dedicated beta testing channel alongside normal updates, outlining the frequency and significance of each release. The video also details how users can install and manage updates through the Brat plugin, ensuring a smoother experience for both beta testers and stable release users.

# Key Takeaways
- The Obsidian Excalidraw plugin will have a new structured release system that includes a dedicated beta testing channel.
- Normal updates will occur approximately once a month and be available in the Obsidian Community plugins store.
- Users can manage beta installations and updates through the Brat plugin, which allows for on-going testing of the latest features while maintaining access to stable versions.

Hey everyone, it's Zsolt here. I wanted to grab a few minutes of your time to explain how the releases of the Obsidian Excalidraw plugin are changing. Essentially, some of you have asked to have less frequent releases because too frequent releases create change fatigue and maybe some anxiety for some of you. So, in this video, I'm going to walk you through that process. From now on, we are going to have a dedicated beta testing channel using the Brat plugin, and we're going to have the normal updates. [* ](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=0)

Let's start with the normal updates. First of all, they're going to be available via the Obsidian Community plugins store, as until now, they will include a release description in the plugin release notes. I'm going to be targeting roughly one release per month, and this is going to happen unless there's some high-impact bugs that surface that need to be addressed mid-month. The plugin will notify you when there's an update available, but of course, you can also go to community plugins to see the updates. The normal monthly update will end typically with a zero in the release number, so your release number will be 2.3.0, 2.4.0, etc. If I have an interim bug fix release, I will bump the minor release number, so it would be 2.3.1 or 2.4.1 for a bug fix release that I need to issue mid-month, and any breaking changes that are not backward compatible will receive a new major version number, meaning 3.0.0 is in some way not compatible with 2.3.0. [* ](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=45)

Now looking at the other side, this is the beta testing side. This is going to be available via the Brat plugin. Updates are going to be announced in the Visual Thinking Workshop Discord beta channel. I recommend that you join that; you will find the link to join Discord in the splash screen when you create a new Excalidraw drawing. Updates are going to be more frequent, or rather say they're going to be as until now‚Äîso typically weekly, or sometimes even multiple times during a week. If I have a beta release, it will carry the release number of the upcoming release with "Beta 1", "Beta 2", etc., to denote the beta releases. [* ](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=116)

So, how does this all look like? Right now, I'm going to be releasing version 2.3.0; it's going to be released for both the Brat beta testing channel and, as this is the beginning of the month, it's going to be published in the normal channel. Then I will start to work on 2.4.0, and I'm going to be releasing Beta 1, Beta 2, etc. By the end of the month, I will release version 2.5.0. Now, there's a bit of a technical nuance here that you need to understand if you're a beta tester. If you're just following the normal channel, you don't need to understand this. If you're a beta tester, then you need to know that if you're doing beta testing, you will need to install the stable releases with Brat as well, and that's because Obsidian will not recognize 2.5.0 as more recent than 2.5.0-D beta 2. It is only Brat that allows you this feature. [* ](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=210)

Now, there are various sources of changes that you need to understand. Some of them are in my control, and some of them are outside my control. Sometimes, changes that are outside my control‚Äîor maybe bug fixes that could be urgent but are in my control‚Äîcan drive a situation where I have urgent bug fixes that need to be deployed. These are typically fixes that I believe may lead to data loss or some severe degradation of plugin features, and maybe some breaking changes that could be introduced by a new Obsidian release. So, if this is the case, that's when I'm going to be issuing a bug fix release mid-month to the normal channel as well. Hopefully, with this, you get a good understanding of how the new release structure is going to work. You will find this visual in the README of the plugin. [* ](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=292)

Now let me show you how you can use Brat. To install Brat, you need to come over to Obsidian settings and, in community plugins, you need to click "Browse" and type in Brat, and then you can just simply install and enable Brat like this. Now, before I'm going to do anything with Brat, I'm going to head back to this list of plugins and click on Excalidraw. I'm going to click on the repository link because we are going to need the repository address to register the plugin in Brat. I'm just going to copy this to the clipboard and head back to Obsidian. Then, in Obsidian, I'm going to start the command palette and type in "Brat add a beta plugin for testing". I'm going to click on this command, paste the repository link here, and once I've pasted it, I can press "Add Plugin" in the top right. I‚Äôm going to see a message that the plugin was added, and now if I check here, you can already see that the plugin automatically updated to the latest beta version. [* ](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=355)

Now, if later on I want to check for a new beta version of the plugin, I can just simply start the command palette, type in "Brat", and I can choose here to choose a single plugin version to update. When I click this, I can choose which plugin I want to test. Currently, I only have Obsidian Excalidraw on my beta plugin list. I then click that, and Brat will check and, here you can see that right now I have the latest beta version. If you decide to be a beta tester for Excalidraw and you want to continue receiving weekly or even more frequent updates with the shiny new things that come from Excalidraw.com and new features that I'm building, then you need to install Brat. With Brat, you will need to install the stable version as well as the interim versions. All you need to do is use the command palette and update a single plugin version as I just showed you, and with that, Brat is going to update the plugin for you. That's all I wanted to share with you today. Hopefully, this will release some of the anxiety for those of you who don't like too frequent updates while still retaining the flexibility for those of you who like to play with the shiny new things. Let me know how it works. Thank you! [* ](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=487)

can also go to community](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=71) [plugins to see the update the normal](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=73) [monthly update will end typically with a](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=77) [zero the release number so your release](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=81) [number will be](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=84)

receive a new major version number](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=112) [meaning](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=115) [3.0.0 is](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=118) [in some way not compatible with](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=120) [2.3.0 now looking at the other side so](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=124) [this is the beta testing side this is](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=127) [going to be available via the brat](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=130) [plug-in updates are going to be](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=133) [announced in the visual thinking](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=136) [Workshop Discord beta Channel I](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=138) [recommend that you join that you will](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=141) [find the link to join Discord in the](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=144) [splash screen when you create a new](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=148) [escalator](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=150) [drawing

is](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=157) [sometime even multiple times during a](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=160) [week if I have a Beta release it will](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=162) [carry

does](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=176) [this all look like like right now I'm](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=179) [going to be releasing](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=181) [2.3.0 it's going to be released for both](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=184) [the brat beta testing Channel and as](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=188) [this is the beginning of the month it's](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=191) [going to be published in the normal](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=193) [Channel then I will start to work on](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=196) [2.4.0 and I'm going to be releasing beta](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=200) [1 beta 2](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=203) [Etc and when the end of the month comes](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=205) [then I'm going to be releasing](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=209) [[Music]](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=212) [2.5.0 now there's a bit of a technical](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=213) [Nuance here that you need to understand](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=216) [if you're a beta tester so if you're](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=220) [just following the normal Channel you](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=222) [don't need to understand this if you're](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=225) [a beta tester then you need to know that](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=227) [if you're doing beta testing you will](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=231) [need to install the stable releases with](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=233) [brat as well and that's because obsidian](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=236) [will not recognize](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=240) [2.5.0 as more recent than](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=243) [2.5.0 D beta 2 it is only brat that](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=246) [allows you this](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=251) [feature now there are various sources of](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=253) [changes that you need to understand some](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=258) [of them are in my control and some of](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=262) [them are outside my control and](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=264) [sometimes changes that are outside my](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=268) [control or maybe bug fixes that could be](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=271) [urgent but they are in my control can](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=275) [drive a situation that I have urgent bug](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=279) [fixes that need to be deployed these are](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=282) [typically fixes that I](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=285) [believe may lead to data loss or some](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=288) [severe degradation of plug-in features](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=292) [and maybe some breaking changes that](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=295) [could be in introduced by a new obsidian](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=298) [release so if this is the case that's](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=301) [when I'm going to be issuing a bug fix](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=304) [release mid Monon to the normal Channel](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=309) [as well so hopefully with this you get a](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=313) [good understanding of how the new](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=317) [release structure is going to work you](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=320) [will find this visual in the read me of](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=322) [the plug-in and now let me show you how](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=326) [you can use brat to install brat you](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=329) [need to come over to obsidian settings](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=332) [and in community plugins you need to](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=335) [click browse and type in brat and then](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=337) [you can just simply install and then](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=341) [enable brat like this now before I'm](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=344) [going to do anything with brat I'm going](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=348) [to head back to this list of plugins and](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=351) [click on excetra and I'm going to click](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=354) [here on the repository link link because](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=357) [we are going to need the repository](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=360) [address to register the plug-in in brat](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=362) [so I'm just going to copy this to the](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=366) [clipboard and head back to obsidian and](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=368) [then in obsidian I'm going to start the](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=372) [command pallet and type in brat add a](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=374) [beta plugin for testing I'm going to](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=379) [click on this command and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=382) [paste the repository link here and once](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=385) [I've pasted it I can press add plugin in](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=389) [the top right I'm going to see a message](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=393) [that the plugin was added and now if I](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=395) [check here then you can already see that](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=399) [the plug-in automatically updated to the](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=402) [latest beta version now if later on I](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=406) [want to check for a new beta version of](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=410) [the plugin I can just simply start the](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=413) [common pallet type in brat and I can](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=415) [choose here to choose a single plugin](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=420) [version to update and when I click this](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=423) [I can choose which plugin I want to test](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=426) [currently I only have obsidian X colit](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=430) [Raw on my Beta plugin list and then I](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=432) [click that then brat will check and here](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=436) [you can see that right now I have the](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=438) [latest beta version if you decide to be](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=441) [a beta tester for exol draw and you want](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=445) [to continue to receive](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=447) [weekly or even more frequent update with](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=450) [the shiny new things that come from](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=453) [exit.com and new features that I'm](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=456) [building then you need to install brat](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=458) [and with brat you will need to install](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=461) [the stable version as well as the](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=464) [interim versions all you need to do is](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=467) [to use the common pallet and update a](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=469) [single plug-in version as I just showed](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY?t=472) [you
