![Excalidraw Scripting - How to Automate On-File-Open Actions in Obsidian](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc)

# Summary
In this video, Jolt explains how to automate specific actions when opening drawings using the Excalidraw plugin in Obsidian. He details how to access and utilize Excalidraw's API and scripting capabilities to perform actions like automatically switching to the hand tool or enabling auto-draw for pens. The tutorial provides practical examples and technical insights for users looking to enhance their drawing workflows through automation.

# Key Takeaways
- Learn how to use the Obsidian developer console to run Excalidraw scripts for automation.
- Discover how to access the Excalidraw API and utilize functions to customize your drawing experience.
- Understand how to create a template for auto-start scripts, enabling consistent automation across multiple drawings.

# Content
Hey everyone, Jolt here. I've received a number of requests and questions on GitHub and on Discord about automatically performing certain actions when you open a drawing. Two particular examples are, in one case, the person wants to automatically switch to the hand tool when opening a drawing on mobile, so this is the hand tool. The other request was about automatically enabling the auto-draw for pen script, or for that matter, any other script. So, in this video, I want to show you how to do this. Warning: this video is going to be more technical. I'm going to go into scripting, we're going to look at code, we are going to look at Templator, we are going to look at a number of technical things. I'm going to go pretty fast; my assumption is if you want to understand it more, you can stop the video, you can rewind, you can rewatch, and hopefully, I'm going to be able to give you some pointers to find your way in Excalidraw to make all of this happen. So let's dive in and get started. [* ](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc)

So, we'll start by opening the Obsidian developer console. You do this by pressing Control + Shift + I or Command + Option + I on a Mac, and that will open this window on the right-hand side. Now, the window might look slightly different, but what you need to look for is the console right here. I'm going to clear the console so we have a clean sheet to work from. I'm going to use this image, the image of The Monkey King, as our reference image to play with today. So, every time when I want to experiment with Excalidraw, I first start by defining my Excalidraw variable. So I start with `EA = xcraAutomate`. Excalidraw Automation is automatically installed when you install Excalidraw, and I like the short form of `EA`. That's why I just simply always start like this. Now, Excalidraw Automate works on the active drawing, but you need to set which drawing to work on, so the next function I always run, and this is really just autopilot, is `EA.setView()` like this, and I just use the brackets right after that and I press enter. With this, Excalidraw Automate automatically attached itself to this drawing on the left-hand side. [* ](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc)

Now, I have some prior knowledge, and I'm going to try to walk you through how you can find out these things for yourself. But in this case, I know that there is a function on the Excalidraw API that allows me to change the tool to the hand tool. So let me show you how I would experiment with this. First of all, I would define my API variable, so Excalidraw Automate has this function `getExcalidrawAPI()` and then I have the API. I can list all the functions in the API by just typing in `API` like this and opening this toggle right here, and I can see these are the functions that are published by Excalidraw for you to use. These are not part of Excalidraw Automate; these are published by the Excalidraw package. Now, if you look through here, you will find this tool called `setActiveTool`, so that is the function that we want to call. But, of course, the issue is you don't know how to call `setActiveTool`. You don't know what values to pass to `setActiveTool`. So, we know that we want to call API `setActiveTool`, but the question is what do I put in the brackets? So for that, I'm going to show you a trick how you can find that out yourself. I’m going to come here to GitHub, and this is the Excalidraw GitHub. So this is not the plugin GitHub; this is the GitHub for the Excalidraw project. Here, in the search, I'm just going to type in `setActiveTool` like this, and you can see that this search is going to run on the Excalidraw repository, and then I press enter. Then, I'm going to get a bunch of hits that are within the Excalidraw repository, and here I can immediately see how to use the tool. So I can see that the tool is used in the sense that it says `setActiveTool()` and then it passes an object, so this is the bit that I'm interested in: an object that sets the type to a value. In terms of the value, well, I'm not going to now search here; I don't immediately see the value, but I'm going to show you a bit later how to find out the value as well. For now, I'll come back here, and I'm going to show you the function in action. So I'm going to add my object saying type and I'm going to— I know that the tool is called hand, and then I'm going to close the bracket and press enter. Voila! You can see that automatically the hand tool was selected. So how did I know that it's the hand tool? How do you find out which tool it is? There's another trick for that, and for that, you need to ask for the application state again through the API. This is the `getAppState()` function, and this is something I recommend looking at if you want to understand what's under the hood in Excalidraw. So I'm going to type in `API.getAppState()` like this, and I'm going to hit enter. Then I'm going to, again, open this object, and here immediately you can see that the app state includes, right at the beginning, the active tool, and you can see type hand. Let me just show you what happens if I switch tools. Maybe I'm going to switch to the rectangle tool, and again I run `getAppState()` and I open this tool, and you will immediately see that now the active tool is type rectangle. So this is how I knew that my active tool is the hand tool. [* ](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc)

So let’s summarize what we know until now. Well, we know that we can access the API through `EA.getExcalidrawAPI()`, and we also know that the `setActiveTool()` function by passing an object that says type hand is going to do the trick for me. So now comes the next point of how I make Excalidraw execute this function on startup. For this, I'm going to switch to Markdown View mode. So I'm going to switch this drawing to Markdown View mode, and you can see my front matter here. If you don't see the front matter, then you need to go to Obsidian settings. You need to go to Editor, and here under Properties in Document, you need to select Source. Now, if you select, because it's probably hidden or if it's visible, then you will get this view, which is the default Obsidian view. I personally don't like this view because I find it hard to—well, first of all, these rows are short, and I cannot read the full Excal or command as well or property, and for me, I'm old-fashioned; I like the old type of view better. So I'm going to switch to Source mode, and here within the front matter, I have a front matter called `excalidraw-`, and if I type `excalidraw-`, then I have this suggestor, and here you can see that I have the unload script, and here there's already an example of what you could put in the unload script. But this is not what I'm going to put in the unload script; I'm going to—so in the unload script, the `EA` object is already available, so that's the Excalidraw Automate object already configured for this view. So you don't need to run `setView()`, and you don't need to run `EA = ExcalAutomate`; that's done for you automatically. All you need to do is here you need to write `EA.getExcalidrawAPI()` so with this, I got the API object, and then I'm going to set active tool, and I'm going to write type hand. Now notice that because I have the quotation marks in the beginning, I'm just using the simple quotation marks, single quotation marks in there, but I could turn it around as well. But just notice that these are two different types of quotation marks there. When I'm done, and when I switch to Excalidraw, I click here to open as a drawing, then immediately you see that here I have the hand tool active. Now, this is not exactly what we wanted, but this was a good demonstration of how you get to the hand tool because what we wanted is for this to happen when we are in mobile view mode. For that, there's an Obsidian API that you can use, and you can access the Obsidian app API by typing in `app.` And in this case, the command that we are looking for is `isMobile()`. Now, of course, if you don't know if `app.isMobile`, you have exactly the same option as before. So I can click on `app`, I can click to open this, and I can start to review all the functions here. But in this case, I do know that the function I'm looking for is `app.isMobile()`, and of course, I'm on a desktop. So in this case, this is not mobile. But now if I come back to my Markdown View mode and I come to my Excalidraw unload script, I can write here: if `app.isMobile()`, then do this. And with this, this drawing, when I open this drawing as an Excalidraw drawing on a mobile, it will automatically turn to the hand tool. Now, it didn’t because I’m on a desktop. I can show you that this works. I open this again in Markdown View mode; I add an exclamation mark here. The exclamation mark says that if it is not mobile, so if it’s a desktop, then it should run the script. So when I switch over to Excalidraw, then you can see that my hand tool was activated. [* ](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc)

Now, you could say that, “Jolt, this is great, but do I need to do this one by one for each of my drawings?” No, of course, and there are two different options that you can do. Let me show you first the easier option. So I’m going to copy this script to my clipboard. Copy, and here in my—actually here, I’m going to use the quick switcher to open my Excalidraw template file. So you have an Excalidraw template file in plugin settings. So here in Excalidraw, under Basic, you can set your template file, and you can see here I have a video that explains all the ins and bolts of the template. But if you set a template, then whatever you put in the template is going to be used for your next drawing. And this is great because you can set your font face, your font color, whatever you want. But in this case, I’m going to again switch to Markdown mode, and here in the front matter, I’m going to add our script, and I’m just going to switch back to my drawing. And now I’m going to open a new drawing, and that drawing, if I switch to Markdown View mode, will already have my script in here. Now, there’s one thing that I want you to pay attention to, and this can trip you up, so I’m just letting you know about the templates that here if I delete my template, then it will deceptively look as if I have a template because that is the pre-filled hint in this field, and the hint looks very much like the text itself. You can see that the color is slightly different, so when I type in `excalotemplate`, then it becomes slightly stronger. But unfortunately, this is not strong enough of a difference. So, if the template doesn’t work for you, then most probably you didn’t fill it in. You can check it because then you cannot select the text. So you can see here that now I’m not able to select the text, but if I paste in `excalotemplate` here, then I can select the text, and this means that I have my template file in the Excalidraw folder, and the file is called template. So, I think that’s just a side note. But where we got to was the following: we created our unload script and we added a check if the app is mobile, then it should switch to the active hand tool. We looked at the Excalidraw API; you understand how you can search GitHub to find out whether you want to use the hand tool. And we inserted this in the template, so all our new drawings open like this. So now this was the first approach that I wanted to show you. Now, let's look at the auto-draw for pens script, and here we're going to look at two additional things that we haven't looked at until now. One is how can you find out—how can I run a script? So that's question number one. Question number two: there's actually a different better way to add your auto-start script to Excalidraw. So I’m going to show you that as well. And before we go there, I’m just going to clean up my template here; I don’t need this in my template file, and we’re going to close this here. [* ](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc)

So how do I know how can I run a script in Excalidraw? Well, the easy thought that you need to keep in mind is all of the scripts are available on the command palette. So here, I can type `autoDrawForPens`, and that is going to run the script. So what does this mean? It means that this is available on the Obsidian API under `commands`. So I’m not going to explore in detail how you can find this out, but of course, if you type in `app` and you start to experiment, you will find this also on the Obsidian members group on Discord. You can ask questions, and you'll get help, and there's plenty of online help about this as well. So what I want to show you is within `app`, there's an object called `commands`, and if I just type in `commands` again like this, and I type a square bracket and a quotation mark, then I can start to write `Excalidraw`, actually it's Obsidian Excalidraw plugin, downloaded, and you get the idea. So here, you can see all of the downloaded scripts. So for example, here’s the auto-draw for pens script. Now, instead of the auto-draw for pens script, I’m going to use the `setGrid` script because auto-draw for pens is going to be—well, it’s not going to be visible on screen, but the `setGrid` script is. So I’m just going to come here and type in `setGrid()` like this. So we found our script; it’s the Obsidian Excalidraw plugin download `setGrid` script or whichever script you want. So now I’m selecting only this part, the name of the script that I wanted, and I can delete this back to execute the script. You can use the Obsidian API. Again, I'm going to write `app.commands` and here I’m going to choose `executeCommandByID()` and I’m going to open my bracket. I’m going to paste my script ID and I’m going to close the bracket, and when I press enter, then you can see that the script was executed. I’m asked about the grid size and I can close this. Now, if I copy this script to my clipboard and I come over to my random image, instead of my startup script that switches to the hand tool, I paste this in here. But again, you need to pay attention to that: now I have the quotation marks that I need to change to these single quotation marks, so that’s why it was red. Now, if I switch back to Excalidraw drawing, then when the drawing is opened, then the grid script is executed, and you can see in the same way you can execute the auto-draw for pens script. Now, the better way or the different way to achieve this is there’s an Excalidraw automate hook that is executed when a file is loaded. To find out about these hooks, you can come to the Excalidraw automate how-to. I don’t quite keep the how-to up to date, so I’m sorry about that. But there’s one part of the how-to that is super useful, and that is the overview of attributes and functions. So when I click here, this opens this page right here. You can also click here on the actual source code, and then it’s going to download it, but you can read it right here. These are all the Excalidraw automate functions with some description around it, and I'm going to look for the `onFileOpen` hook. So you can see here this is the `hook`. The way the hooks work is, if you give the hook a value, then the hook will be executed whenever the hook needs to be executed. So you can see here, on file create, on file open, on paste, etc. But now we are going to use the `onFileOpen` hook, and then you can place your script there. The hook will receive a data object that will have these three values with them. So let's see how this works. I'm going to come over here, and I'm going to just add to my `onFileOpen`. That was the name, right? `onFileOpen` hook. `onFileOpenHook = (data) => {...}`. And right now, for demonstration, I'm going to add that this should be a console log data. So now, all I'm going to do is then I open a drawing; it is going to execute this script and print the data value to the console log. So when I press enter, then nothing happened or actually the hook was installed. Now, if I close this and open this drawing again, then you will see that, well, two things happen: of course the grid script was executed, but here the console log data was also added, and you can see here that I have my Excalidraw file open, and you can see here that the file is called random image. I have all this data here. So that reminds me to, first of all, remove the unload script like this. I’m going to switch back to Excalidraw drawing. And so what do we do with this information? Well, we're going to use Templator to automatically start our script when Obsidian starts up, and Templator is going to install the on file open hook to Excalidraw. So how do we do this? I'm going to open my Templator folder here, and in Templator, I have a subfolder called startup. You don’t necessarily need to have it in a subfolder; I like to keep my startup scripts separately. So here, I’m going to type in to create a new script, and I’m going to call this `EAUnload`. So this is going to be the name of my script. And the way to create a template or script is like this— I add the opening and the closing sign, so this will tell Templator that we have a template script to be executed. And now we can start to write our script. Before we write the script, I have a small trick that I create a JavaScript comment. So this is how you create a comment like this, and whatever you write here is not going to execute; it’s just text or a comment. Instead of having that random text in my comment, I’m going to add my JavaScript code block header like that. So under this, now when I write, then Obsidian is going to do the formatting of my source code, and I’m going to create a very quick script here. I’m going to start by creating, so maybe I’m going to copy the script, and I’m going to walk you through the script. I’m going to share the script in the video description so you can find it for yourself. But here, let me just explain to you; this is probably easier and faster what I’m doing here. So the script itself has a lot of supporting material; this is at the heart of the script. So I’m adding to the window `excalidrawAutomate.onFileOpenHook`, so this is exactly the same as we did earlier. Here that I no longer have here, so this was the `EA onFileOpenHook = (data) => {...}`; that’s the same. Just instead of `EA` here, I’m referencing the `window.excalidrawAutomate.onFileOpenHook`, so I’m writing out the entire name of this object, and I’m adding the same function. So this is my function right here, and I’m going to just add after the initialization a quick note in the console log that the script was successfully installed or the unload hook was successfully installed. So this is part one. I created my unload template. Part two is I need to go to the Templator settings. So here’s the Templator settings. I need to scroll down to the startup templates, and here I need to choose my startup template. And let’s just search for the `startupEAOnload` template like this, and I’m just going to click here to add a new startup template. With this, I’ve added my `EA startupEAUnload` markdown file as a template, which is this template right here. And now if I restart Obsidian, I’m going to use the command palette reload app without saving. I’m going to hit enter. This will restart Obsidian, and I can open the developer console, and hopefully, in the developer console, I can see the message `Excalidraw onFileOpenHook is installed`. And if I now open a drawing—so I’m going to come here and open my random image—then when I open the drawing, the script is executed and I can enjoy the benefits of running the script automatically. I'm checking is that, yes indeed, my Excalidraw onFileOpen tag is not here. So this was, in fact, the Templator, the on-file-open hook that I installed with Templator that does this. [* ](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc)

So again, I recognized that this video was fast-paced, and this was pretty technical. But I hope I have shown you a couple of tips and tricks in terms of finding your way in the Obsidian API, in the Excalidraw API, and in Excalidraw Automate's function by searching GitHub, by looking at the help available. Overall, I also hope that building on these two examples, you can create the automation you need for your on-start script, and this will make Excalidraw even better for your workflows. If you have any questions or if you have suggestions for other similar videos, then please, in the comments below, let me know, and I'll try to respond to them. Thank you.

just](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=151) [autopilot is EA set view like this and I](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=154) [just use the brackets right after that](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=159) [and I press enter and with this exol dra](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=163) [automate automatically attached itself](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=166) [to this drawing on the left hand side](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=169) [now I have some prior knowledge and I'm](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=173) [going to try to walk you through how you](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=176) [can find out these things for yourself](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=178) [but in this case I know that there is a](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=182) [function on the exro API that allows me](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=185) [to change the tool to the hand tool so](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=190) [let me show you how I would experiment](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=194) [with this what I would do is first of](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=197) [all I would Define my API variable so](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=199) [exol dra automate has this function get](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=204) [exol dra API and then I I have the API I](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=207) [can list all the functions in the API by](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=211) [just simply typing in API like this and](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=213) [opening uh this toggle right here and I](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=217) [can see these are the functions that are](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=221) [published by exol draw for you to use](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=224) [these are not part of exol dra automate](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=229) [these are published by the exol draw](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=231) [package now if you look through here you](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=233) [will find this tool called set active](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=236) [tool so that is the tool that we or the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=240) [function that we want to call but of](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=243) [course the issue is you don't know how](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=246) [to call set active tool you don't know](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=249) [what values to pass to set active tool](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=252) [so we know that we want to call Api set](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=255) [active tool but the question is what do](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=259) [I put in the bracket so for that I'm](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=263) [going to show you a trick how you can](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=268) [find that out yourself so I'm going to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=270) [come here](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=273) [to GitHub and this is the exol draw](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=275) [GitHub so this is not the plug-in GitHub](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=279) [this is the GitHub for the exol draw](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=282) [project and here in the search I'm just](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=284) [going to type in set active tool like](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=288) [this and you can see that this search is](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=293) [going to run on the exol draw rep](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=296) [repository and then I press enter then](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=299) [I'm going to get a bunch of hits that](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=303) [are within the exol draw repository and](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=307) [here I can immediately see how to use](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=311) [the tool so I can see that the tool is](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=313) [used in this sense that it says set](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=316) [active tool and then it passes an object](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=320) [so this is the bit that I'm interested](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=323) [in object that sets the type to a value](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=325) [and in terms of the value well I'm not](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=329) [going to now search here I don't](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=332) [immediately see the value but I'm going](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=335) [to show you a bit later how to find out](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=338) [the value as well for now I'll come back](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=340) [here and I'm going to show you the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=344) [function in action so I'm going to add](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=347) [my object saying type and I'm going to I](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=349) [know that the tool is called](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=353) [hand and then I'm going to close the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=356) [bracket and press enter and voila you](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=359) [can see that automatically the hand tool](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=362) [was selected so how did I know that it's](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=365) [the hand tool or how do you find out](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=369) [which tool it is there's another trick](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=372) [for that and for that you need to ask](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=375) [for](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=378) [the application State again through the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=379) [API so this is the get app State](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=383) [function and this is something I](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=386) [recommend looking at if you want to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=388) [understand what's under the hood in](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=391) [excal draw so I'm going to type in API](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=393) [get app State like this and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=396) [hit enter and then I'm going to again](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=399) [open this object and here immediately](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=402) [you can see that the App State includes](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=405) [right at the beginning the active tool](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=409) [and you can see type hand and let me](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=412) [just show you what happens if I switch](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=414) [tools maybe I'm going to switch to the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=416) [rectangle tool and again I run get app](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=419) [State and I open this tole and you will](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=423) [immediately see that now the active tool](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=427) [is type rectangle so this is how I knew](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=429) [that my active tool is the hand tool so](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=434) [let's summarize what we know until now](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=438) [well we know that we can access the API](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=441) [through EA get exol draw API I and we](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=446) [also know that the set active](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=450) [tool function by passing an object that](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=452) [says type hand is going to do the trick](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=457) [for me so now comes the next point of](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=460) [how I make exol draw execute this](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=464) [function on Startup so for this I'm](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=467) [going to switch to markdown View mode so](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=471) [I'm going to switch this drawing to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=474) [markdown View mode and you can see my](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=476) [front mat](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=478) [here if you don't see the front matter](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=480) [then you need to go to obsidian settings](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=483) [you need to go to editor and here under](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=485) [properties in document you need to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=490) [select Source now if you select because](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=493) [it's probably hidden or if it's visible](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=496) [then you will get this view which is the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=500) [default](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=504) [obsidian view I personally don't like](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=505) [this view because I find it hard to well](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=509) [first of all these uh rows are short and](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=512) [I cannot read the full exol or command](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=516) [as well or property and for me I'm I I](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=519) [I'm oldfashioned I like the old type of](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=522) [view better so I'm going to switch to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=525) [Source mode and here within the front](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=527) [matter I have a front matter called exol](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=531) [draw Dash and if I type exol draw](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=536) [Dash then I can I have this suggestor](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=539) [and you can see here that I have the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=543) [unload script and here there's already](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=546) [an example of what you could put in the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=550) [unload script but this is not what I'm](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=552) [going to put in the unload script but](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=555) [I'm going to so in the unload script the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=558) [EA object is already available so that's](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=560) [the exol draw automate object already](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=564) [configured for this view so you don't](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=568) [need to run set View and you don't need](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=570) [to run EA equals excal automate that's](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=573) [done for you automatically all you need](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=577) [to do is here you need to write EA](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=580) [get](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=587) [exol raw API so with this I got the API](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=589) [object and then I'm going to set active](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=594) [tool and I'm going to write](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=600) [type hand now notice that because I have](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=603) [the quotation marks in the beginning I'm](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=608) [just using the simple quotation single](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=611) [quotation marks in there but I could](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=614) [turn it around as well but just notice](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=616) [that these are two different type of](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=619) [quotation marks there and when I'm done](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=621) [and when I switch to exol dra so I quick](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=625) [click here to open as a drawing then](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=629) [immediately you see that here I have the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=633) [hand tool](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=636) [active now this is not exactly what we](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=638) [wanted but this was a good demonstration](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=640) [of how you get to the hand tool because](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=643) [what we wanted is for this to happen](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=646) [when we are in mobile view mode for that](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=649) [there's an obsidian API that you can use](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=654) [and you can access the obsidan Oban API](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=657) [by typing in app Dot and in this case](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=660) [the command that we are looking for is](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=666) [is mobile now of course if you don't](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=668) [know it's app is mobile you have exactly](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=670) [the same option as before so I can click](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=674) [on app I can click to open this and I](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=677) [can start to review all the functions](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=680) [here and explore these functions but in](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=683) [this case I do know that the function](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=687) [I'm looking for is app is mobile and of](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=689) [course I'm on a desktop so in this case](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=692) [this is not a mobile but now if I come](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=696) [back to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=698) [my markdown View mode and I come to my](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=699) [exol unload script I can write here if](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=703) [app is](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=708) [mobile then do this and with this this](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=710) [drawing when I open this drawing as an](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=716) [call it R drawing on a mobile it will](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=719) [automatically turn to the hand tool now](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=722) [it didn't because I'm on a desktop I can](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=724) [show you that this works I open this](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=727) [again in markdown View mode I add an](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=729) [exclamation mark here the exclamation](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=732) [mark says that if it is not mobile so if](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=735) [it's a desktop then it should run the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=740) [script so when I switch over to exol](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=742) [drawing then you can see that my hand](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=745) [tool was](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=748) [activated now you could say that jolt](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=750) [this is great but do I need to do this](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=753) [one by one for each of my](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=756) [drawings no of course and there are two](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=759) [different options that you can do let me](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=763) [show you first the say the easier option](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=765) [so I'm going to copy this script to my](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=770) [clipboard copy and here in](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=774) [my actually here I'm going to use the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=777) [quick switcher to open my exro template](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=781) [file so you have an exol draw template](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=785) [file in plug-in settings so here in exol](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=789) [draw under](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=792) [basic you can set your template file and](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=794) [you can see here I have a video that](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=798) [explains all the NS and bolts of the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=801) [template but if you set a template then](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=804) [whatever you put in the template is](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=808) [going to be used for your next drawing](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=810) [and this is great because you can set](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=814) [your font face your font color whatever](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=815) [you want but in this case I'm going to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=818) [again switch to markdown mode and here](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=821) [in the front matter I'm going to add our](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=824) [script and I'm just going to switch back](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=827) [to my drawing and now I'm going to open](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=830) [a new drawing and that drawing if I](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=834) [switch to markdown View mode we'll](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=837) [already have my script in](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=840) [here now there's one thing that I want](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=843) [you to pay attention to and this can](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=845) [trip you up so I'm just letting you know](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=848) [about the templates that here if I](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=851) [delete my template then it will](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=855) [deceptively look as if I have a template](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=858) [because that is the pre-filled hint in](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=861) [this field and the hint looks very much](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=865) [like](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=868) [the text itself you can see that the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=869) [color is slightly different so when I](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=871) [type in excolo template then it becomes](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=873) [slightly stronger but unfortunately this](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=876) [is not strong enough of a difference so](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=879) [if the template doesn't work for you](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=883) [then most probably you didn't fill it in](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=886) [you can check it because then you cannot](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=889) [select the text so you can see here that](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=891) [now I'm not able to select the text but](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=894) [if I paste in excal template here then I](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=896) [can select the text and this means that](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=900) [I have my template file in the exol draw](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=903) [folder and the file is called template](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=905) [so I think that's just a side note but](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=909) [where we got to was the following we](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=913) [created our](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=917) [unstart or unload script and we added a](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=920) [check if the app is mobile then it](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=926) [should switch to the active hand tool we](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=929) [looked at the xcolor API you understand](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=932) [how you can search GitHub to find out](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=935) [whether you want to use the hand tool](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=939) [and we inserted this in the template so](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=941) [all our new drawings open like](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=944) [this so now this was the first approach](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=947) [that I wanted to show you now let's look](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=951) [at the autodraw for pens script and here](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=955) [we're going to look at two additional](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=959) [things that we haven't looked at until](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=962) [now one is how can you find out how can](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=964) [you run a script so that's question](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=969) [number one question number two there's](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=972) [actually a different better way to add](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=974) [your auto start script to excal draw so](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=978) [I'm going to show you that as well and](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=982) [before we go there I'm was going to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=985) [clean up my temp template here I don't](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=987) [need this in my template file and we're](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=989) [going to close this here](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=993) [so how do I know what's the how can I](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=996) [run a script an excital script from code](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1000) [well the easy thought that you need to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1005) [keep in mind is all of the scripts are](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1009) [available on the command pallet so here](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1012) [I can type](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1015) [Auto draw for pen and that is going to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1017) [run the script so what does this mean it](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1021) [means that this is available on the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1025) [obsidian API under Commons so I'm not](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1028) [going](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1033) [to explore in detail how you can find](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1034) [this out but of course if you type in](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1037) [app and you start to experiment you will](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1039) [find this also on the obsidian members](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1043) [group on Discord you can ask questions](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1046) [and you'll get help and there's plenty](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1049) [of online help about this as well so](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1051) [what I want to show you is within app](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1055) [there's](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1059) [a an object called commands and if I](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1061) [just type in commands again like this](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1066) [and I type a square bracket and a](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1070) [quotation mark then I can start to write](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1074) [X exol](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1078) [draw actually it's obsidian xol draw](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1081) [obsidian ex colid draw](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1085) [plugin downloaded and you get the idea](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1090) [so here you can see all of the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1093) [downloaded scripts so for example here's](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1095) [the autodraw for pens script now instead](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1100) [of autodraw for pens script I'm going to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1104) [use the set G grid script because autod](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1107) [draw for pen is going to be well it's](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1111) [not going to be visible on screen but](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1113) [the set grid script is so I'm just going](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1117) [to come here and type](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1121) [in set grid like this so we found our](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1124) [script it's the obsidian exol draw](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1129) [plugin download set grid script or](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1132) [whichever script you want so now I'm](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1136) [selecting only this part the name of the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1138) [script that I wanted and I can delete](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1141) [this back to execute the script you can](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1144) [use the obsidian API again I'm going to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1147) [write app commands and here I'm going to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1150) [choose the execute command by ID and I'm](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1154) [going to open my bracket I'm going to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1159) [paste my script ID and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1162) [close the bracket and when I press press](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1166) [enter Then you can see that the script](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1168) [was executed I'm asked about the crit](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1171) [size and I can close this now if I copy](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1174) [this script to my clipboard and I come](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1179) [over to my random image and instead of](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1183) [my startup script that switches to the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1187) [hand tool I paste this in here but again](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1190) [you need to pay attention to that now I](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1194) [have the the quotation marks that I need](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1197) [to change to these single quotation](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1200) [marks](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1203) [so that's why it was red now if I switch](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1204) [back to exol draw drawing then when the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1209) [drawing is opened then the grid script](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1212) [is executed and you can see in the same](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1216) [way you can execute the autodraw for](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1219) [pens](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1222) [script now the better way or the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1223) [different way to achieve this is](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1227) [there's an a an exol](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1231) [automate hook which is executed when a](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1234) [file is loaded to find out about these](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1239) [hooks you can come to the excal automate](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1242) [howto I don't quite keep the howto up to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1246) [date so I'm sorry about that but there's](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1250) [one part of the how to that is super](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1253) [useful and that is is the overview of](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1256) [attributes and functions so when I click](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1260) [here this opens this page right here you](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1262) [can also click here on the actual source](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1266) [code and then it's going to download it](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1270) [but you can read it right here these are](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1273) [all the excal automate functions with](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1276) [some description around it and I'm going](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1280) [to look for the on file open hook so you](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1283) [can see here this is the hook the way](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1288) [the hooks work is if you give the hook a](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1291) [value then the hook will be](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1295) [executed when ever the hook needs to uh](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1298) [be executed so you can see here on file](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1302) [create on file open on paste Etc but now](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1305) [we are going to use the on file open](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1310) [hook and then you can place your script](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1313) [there the hook hook will receive a data](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1317) [object that will have these three values](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1319) [to them so let's see how this works I'm](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1323) [going to come over here I'm going to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1327) [just add to my on](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1331) [file open that was the name right on](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1335) [file open hook on](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1339) [file open hook equals I'm going to say](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1343) [data like this and right now for](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1349) [demonstration I'm going to add that this](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1352) [should be a console](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1355) [log data so now all I'm going to do is](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1358) [then I open a drawing then it is going](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1362) [to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1365) [execute this script and print the data](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1367) [value to the console log so when I press](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1370) [enter then nothing happened or actually](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1373) [the Hook was installed now if](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1377) [I close this and open this drawing again](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1382) [then you will see that well two things](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1387) [happen of course the grid script was](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1389) [executed but](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1391) [here the console log data was also added](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1393) [and you can see here that I have my exol](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1397) [draw file open and you can see here that](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1403) [the file is called random image I have](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1405) [all this data here so that reminds me to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1407) [first of all remove the unload script](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1412) [like this I'm going to switch back to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1416) [exol draw drawing and so what do we do](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1419) [with this information well we're going](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1423) [to use templator to automatically start](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1426) [our script when obsidian starts up and](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1430) [templator is going to to install the on](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1436) [file open hook to exol draw so how do we](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1439) [do this I'm going to open my templator](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1444) [folder here and in templator I have a](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1449) [subfolder called startup you don't](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1452) [necessarily need to have it in a](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1455) [subfolder I like to keep my startup](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1457) [scripts separately so here I'm going to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1460) [type in to create a](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1464) [new uh script and I'm going to call this](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1466) [EA unload so this is going to be the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1470) [name of my script and to way to create a](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1473) [template or script is like this that I](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1477) [add the opening and the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1481) [closing sign so this this will](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1486) [tell templator that we have a template](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1489) [script to be executed and now we can](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1493) [start to write our](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1496) [script before we write the script I have](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1498) [a small trick that I create a](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1502) [JavaScript uh comment so this is how you](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1505) [create a comment like this and whatever](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1509) [you write here is not going to executed](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1511) [it's just a text or comment and instead](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1514) [of having that random text in my comment](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1517) [I'm going to add my JavaScript code](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1521) [block header like that and so so under](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1524) [this now when I write then obsidian is](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1528) [going to do the formatting of my source](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1531) [code and I'm going to create a very](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1533) [quick script here I'm going to start by](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1537) [creating so maybe I'm going to copy the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1541) [script and I'm going to walk you through](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1545) [the script and I'm going to share the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1547) [script in the video description so you](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1551) [can find it for](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1554) [yourself um but here let me just explain](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1556) [to you this is probably easier and](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1559) [faster what I'm doing here so the script](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1561) [itself has a lot](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1565) [of supporting material this is at the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1568) [heart of the script so I'm adding to the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1572) [window exol dra automate on the file](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1575) [open hook so this is exactly the same as](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1579) [we did earlier](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1583) [here that I no longer have here so this](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1586) [was the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1590) [EA on file open hoook equal data so](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1591) [that's the same just instead of EA here](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1596) [I'm ref referencing the window excal](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1599) [automate on file open hook so I'm](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1602) [writing out the entire name of this](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1605) [object and I'm adding the same function](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1608) [so data and here I have my function now](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1612) [in this case I in include this line here](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1616) [in the script I'm not needing it now but](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1619) [I'm including this for reference and you](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1622) [can see here that again I have the set](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1625) [grid script but as you saw earlier I](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1628) [could add the uh any other script I](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1632) [wanted so what does the script do well](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1637) [the script starts with this part in the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1640) [beginning where I have these two lines](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1642) [of code so what does this do](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1646) [I check if because when obsidian starts](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1649) [up then plugins start one by one after](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1653) [another and it could be that excal](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1656) [automate is started after templator](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1660) [starts so because I don't know when](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1662) [templator runs the auto start script](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1666) [whether I'm going to have excal](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1669) [available or not I need to check if](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1671) [excal dra automate is available and to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1675) [avoid getting into an infinite Loop](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1678) [because what if I've turned off EXC](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1681) [Coler automate then this is going to run](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1683) [in the background eating](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1685) [resources I add a watchdog the Watchdog](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1688) [is simply a counter that after trying 50](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1691) [times I'm going to stop trying and give](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1695) [up so the way this works is I initialize](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1699) [watch do to zero then I run this V](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1704) [script or V Loop and in the v loop I](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1708) [check if exol automate is still not](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1713) [available and If we have not yet reached](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1716) [50 by adding watch do Plus+ I increase](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1719) [the value of the variable here uh in](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1723) [place then I evate 50 milliseconds until](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1727) [I try again you can make this to 100](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1732) [milliseconds or whatever ever so this is](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1735) [up to you what timing you want to add](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1738) [here but anyway after 50 tries if exol](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1741) [draw is still not available then before](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1745) [moving on so when the watch doog reaches](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1749) [50 or if excal dra automate is available](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1753) [then the code is going to move to the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1756) [next line and here if excal dra automate](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1758) [is still not available then I'm going to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1761) [exit the further execution if if however](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1764) [exol automate is available then I'm](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1768) [going to set the value of the on file](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1771) [open hook to my function so this is my](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1774) [function right here and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1778) [just add after the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1782) [initialization a quick note in the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1784) [console log that the script was](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1787) [successfully installed or the unload](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1791) [Hook was successfully installed so this](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1793) [is part part one I created my unload](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1796) [template part two is I need to go to the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1800) [templator settings so here's the](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1804) [templator settings I need to scroll down](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1806) [to the startup templates and here I need](https://youtu.be/OX5_UYjXEvc?t=1809) [to choose my startup template and
