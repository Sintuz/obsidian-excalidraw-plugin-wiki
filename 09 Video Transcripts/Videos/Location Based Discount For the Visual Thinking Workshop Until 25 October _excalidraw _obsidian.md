One week ago, I launched the visual thinking workshop self-paced course and with that, a completely new cohort experience. I'm super proud of both of them. One reason for creating the course was to make visual thinking more accessible to everyone, and one feedback that I've been receiving is that the price for some locations is just too high. So, I'm running an experiment for one week until the end of day, October 25th. I'm offering location-based discounts. Check the link below; if there's a coupon code displayed, it means you have a location-based discount. Choose either the self-paced course or join the cohort, or join office hours. During checkout, use the coupon code and you'll receive a better price. See you at the workshop! [* ](https://youtu.be/gNKyOEqc-Nc?t=0)
