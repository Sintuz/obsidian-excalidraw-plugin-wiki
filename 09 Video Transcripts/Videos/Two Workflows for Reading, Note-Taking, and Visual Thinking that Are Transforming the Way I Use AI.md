![Two Workflows for Reading, Note-Taking, and Visual Thinking that Are Transforming the Way I Use AI](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt shares two innovative workflows that enhance reading, note-taking, and visual thinking while addressing privacy concerns related to AI tools. The first workflow combines audiobooks and ChatGPT for reflective engagement during non-fiction reading, allowing for the thoughtful integration of insights into a personal knowledge base. The second workflow utilizes Notebook LM to generate podcasts and visual mind maps, creating a rich and organized overview of visual thinking topics.

# Key Takeaways
- Zsolt emphasizes the importance of privacy when using AI tools for personal knowledge management.
- The first workflow involves listening to audiobooks, pausing to reflect with ChatGPT, and summarizing insights in Obsidian for effective information retention.
- The second workflow uses Notebook LM to collate information into podcasts and mind maps, facilitating deeper understanding and organization of visual thinking concepts.

Hey, welcome back! I'm Zsolt. If you watched my previous video, you will know that I have some concerns about AI tools, especially sharing all my personal notes with a tool like ChatGPT. I know it would give me amazing insights, new connections, and creative ideas, but because I don't know what is going to happen with my data, I have privacy concerns. But that doesn't mean that I don't use AI tools on a daily basis. Indeed, they've become second nature. I use them every hour, not just every day. I use tools like Notion, Hippo Notebook, and a whole host of others, and they are really part of my everyday life. In fact, today, I want to share with you two new workflows that I've been experimenting with that balance privacy with creativity and productivity. I think these two workflows blend these two worlds together very nicely. I'm going to include timestamps, so we're going to talk about one workflow, and then later on in the video, I'm going to share a second workflow. If the first one is not so interesting, you can jump ahead and look at the second one. I think both are very interesting workflows; they are changing my perspective on how I read and process information. [* ](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec)

The first one is about reading books, especially non-fiction books. Before we dive into the process, let me just show you some of the output that I was able to generate using this workflow. In cohort 11 of the Visual Thinking Workshop, we're reading "The Extended Mind" by Annie Murphy Paul, and I thought it would be nice to create summaries where I demonstrate the different ways our brains work with the external environment and tools in personas. So you can see here that, for example, chapter one, "Thinking with Sensations," I came up with three personas: the detective, the nature observer, and the participant. I'm not going into details; maybe I'll do a book on a page later on. Here, I just wanted to highlight these three personas. Then if I look at chapter two, "Thinking in Movement," I have the dancer, the athlete, and the sculptor, and then also the pentamime artist, the preverbal communicator, and the conductor. I have the gazer, the camper, the nurturer, and here I have the monk, the nesting parent, and the architect. I think this way of capturing each chapter's essence is such a neat method for me. All of these personas have so much to say, and they remind me vividly about the book. But let me show you how I got to this point. Before that, let me take one step back and share a couple of thoughts about audiobooks. Because in the past, you asked me, even one month ago, I would have said audiobooks are fantastic for fiction; if it's narrated well, it can be a super immersive experience. But when it comes to non-fiction—technical books, business books, self-help books—I found that audiobooks are often ineffective. The more abstract the topic, the harder it is to concentrate on an audiobook. I found that I may listen to an audiobook on a topic, but by the end, I have absolutely no recollection of what the book was about. Maybe I can talk for five minutes about the book, but ask me any detail, and it's gone. I couldn't capture it in my mind. My advocacy has been that if you’re reading something non-fiction, then get a copy of the book, either a physical book or a Kindle. Do your highlights, import the highlights into your note-taking system, go through a process like Progressive Summarization, create illustrations, book-on-a-page summaries, and integrate the knowledge into your other notes, then you will internalize it. Now, with "The Extended Mind," I'm experimenting with a new workflow, and I think it is really working very well. The workflow is very simple: as I read, I have ChatGPT open on my phone, so I'm listening to the book on Audible on my phone, and I have the ChatGPT app also open on my phone. After about 5 to 10 minutes of listening to a chapter, I pause the chapter and head over to ChatGPT and start an interactive voice conversation where I share some of my reflections. [* ](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec)

We have a short discussion. I explain to ChatGPT that I don't want long conversations; I'm using it more as a reflective notebook. However, in some cases, the feedback I'm getting from ChatGPT helps me fine-tune my ideas or helps me articulate those ideas better, especially as I'm not a native speaker. For me, having that additional help to properly articulate my ideas is beneficial. So that's essentially the workflow: as I go through the book, I pause every few minutes whenever there's an interesting idea or it triggers a thought, I note down connections to my vault. For example, here I'm noting down a connection to "Thinking, Fast and Slow" and System 2 thinking. I have some other links mentioned as well. What I'm doing here is referencing "The Tipping Point." The way I’m using ChatGPT is as a reflective partner who’s able to summarize at the end. The important thing is, when I get to the end of all of this, I ask ChatGPT to create a summary for me. So here’s the summary, and in Obsidian, I add this summary. You can see here that I imported this summary. I don't import chapter highlights; I don’t import anything from the book. All I do is import the summary of my conversation with ChatGPT into my notes in Obsidian. Then, I flip this note around. If you don’t understand what flipping a note around is, I’m going to link a video in the description that explains the two-sided notes. I flip this note around, and on the other side of the note, I create the illustration that we discussed with ChatGPT. There are a couple of practical learning points along the way that I wanted to share. One learning is when I speak for a long time—if I’m doing reflections and it’s a longer reflection—ChatGPT has a tendency of interrupting me. What I also learned is if I press and hold the screen, then ChatGPT will not respond until I let go of the screen. So that's a great way to reflect without feeling that I'm under time pressure and need to keep talking. The second learning I took away is that if I sit at the computer and do the same process, I get distracted. I listen to the book, and then think I can multitask and start browsing the internet, and then the experience is lost. So for this process, I recommend pacing around your room or going for a walk in the park. I even did this while driving because, essentially, listening to an audiobook and then chatting with ChatGPT doesn’t require much attention on the phone. If you’re driving in city traffic, you’re standing anyway in line or at the traffic light, you have plenty of time to use these tools. I found that, for this workflow to work, I need to be engaged in some activity that prevents me from wandering off in other directions. The third insight is when ChatGPT creates the summary, I recommend doing the summary immediately after you finish the chapter. So don’t go from chapter to chapter; instead, at the end of each chapter, create the summary, import it into your note-taking system, and make the illustration before moving on to the next chapter. This will help you solidify what you've read so far, as well as keep the ideas fresh in your mind. I found that sometimes ChatGPT excluded things from the summary that I thought were important or included new ideas that I didn’t mention. I’m sure that if I had imported those summaries a couple of days later, I wouldn’t have remembered all the details. Thus, reviewing ChatGPT's output immediately afterward is very helpful. The fourth best practice is to start a new chat for each chapter. Each chapter has a separate chat; at the beginning of each chat, I have a short explanation for ChatGPT that I'm listening to the book and taking mental notes. I indicate I don’t want long conversations and prefer to use it as a note-taking tool, and I’ll prompt it when I want to discuss. This way, I can segregate each of the chapters for easier handling and avoid spilling over information from one chapter to another. That’s the first workflow, and I think it is super powerful! I very much enjoy doing this. I don’t have a ChatGPT subscription; I’m using the free version, and it is good enough for me. This workflow works, and it’s really easy to do. You don’t need any subscriptions. Just grab an audiobook and try this workflow; I promise it will change the way you think about reading. [* ](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec)

One final thought that links back to "Thinking with Movement" from Murphy Paul is the idea that as a species, we evolved to move, and thinking still and concentrating is not our natural strength. There’s an interesting dilemma here because reading is generally done sitting down; if you move, the letters move. It's almost impossible to read while walking, or at least you will read much slower and the process becomes inefficient in both ways. I think the additional value of this new workflow is that I can incorporate the element of motion while reading. Murphy Paul explains that motion has many positive effects on our cognitive abilities. So, if you go for a walk in the park—especially so—I think thinking in natural spaces is much better for cognitive function compared to built spaces like cities. If you go for a walk in a park, listen to the audiobook and chat with ChatGPT about your notes, I think you’re going to have a super immersive reading experience. Now, onto the other workflow I want to share with you. Let me show you the output I generated with that workflow. This is a mind map of all the different benefits and facets of visual thinking. It’s a comprehensive overview of various ideas, tools for visual thinking, as well as its different benefits and use cases. This is a huge mind map! By the way, if you want to access this mind map, I'm going to include a link in the video description. I’ve posted it here on the Visual Thinking Workshop website. There’s a podcast related to this as well, and I’m going to get into that in a second. You can download the podcast, and I have the Excalidraw mind map right here, so you can explore this. If you want, you can save it as a file in your own Excalidraw environment and rearrange it for your needs; I included all these different book covers here, so if a topic interests you, you can purchase those books to explore the topic further. This can serve as a good starting point to delve into the idea of visual thinking. But in terms of the workflow that got me to this output, I used a tool called Notebook LM. I imported all the books and notes I had around visual thinking into Notebook LM, so this now includes everything I've read and encountered regarding visual thinking. Then, I went through a couple of rounds of prompts. Let me show you the overall workflow I went through: I uploaded my books to Notebook LM, then I generated a podcast overview. You can prompt Notebook LM with a podcast. Here, if I delete this podcast, you’ll see that I can customize my podcast prompt, adding whatever I’d like within a limit of 500 characters. I can guide Notebook LM on the prompt. This was my final prompt, so these were the 500 characters I used to generate the podcast you can find on the Visual Thinking Workshop website. I uploaded the podcast, and once I was happy with it, I downloaded it from Notebook LM and converted it with Audacity to MP3, so I could import it into my Obsidian vault. The file size isn’t too big, so this is my podcast. I also used Notebook LM to transcribe the audio file. For the downloaded podcast, I clicked on "ADD source" and pasted the downloaded audio file, which created its own transcription. I copied this podcast transcript into my notes in Obsidian. Here’s my podcast transcript, and I also saved it in a file. After that, I headed over to ChatGPT, uploaded my podcast there, and asked it to create a Mermaid mind map of this podcast, returning the results in a code block. It first created a mind map, but unfortunately, Obsidian Excalidraw doesn’t handle mind maps well, so I went and asked ChatGPT to convert this into the flowchart type of Mermaid chart. I copied this Mermaid chart to the clipboard and went over to Excalidraw. In Excalidraw, under more tools, there’s the Mermaid to Excalidraw feature. I pasted my chart there; it was originally a top-down chart. I changed it to left-right orientation, made some tweaks such as adjusting colors and line types, and then organized the branches for a more intuitive layout. As I was reading the page, I split the view: on the right, I had the mind map, which I started to rearrange, while on the left, I had the text. As I read the text, I created illustrations for key ideas. Each book cover linked to my vault, creating a map of content for visual thinking. By checking the backlinks in Obsidian, I showcased all the referenced books and topics. With these workflows, I processed my notes, generating a transcript by feeding materials into Notebook LM. I created a Mermaid outline of the mind map using ChatGPT and rearranged the branches while listening to the generated podcast. This allowed me to bridge my notes with a broader view of visual thinking, making all my research easily accessible. Overall, I created an overview that connects all the books I read into one concise format, providing a helpful reference for future exploration of visual thinking. This new method deepens my understanding of familiar topics and uncovers many insights. [* ](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec)

In summary, these are the two workflows I wanted to share with you: one involves listening to audiobooks while taking mental notes in ChatGPT, while the other consists of feeding knowledge into Notebook LM, generating a podcast, downloading texts, creating a mind map, and crafting a visual integration of the topic from a fresh perspective. I believe these workflows are fundamentally changing how I interact with information and knowledge. They link back to visual thinking, help me connect ideas, and allow me to be selective about the information I share with AI tools. In this case, I’m sharing books and articles—not my private notes—and this method minimizes privacy concerns. I recommend trying both workflows; they’re free! Notebook LM is free, ChatGPT is free, and the tools Excalidraw and Obsidian are also free. There is nothing preventing you from exploring these tools, and the potential benefits are immense. I see little downside to experimenting with these workflows, and I’m extremely interested in hearing your thoughts and workflows in the comments below. I continue to explore AI tools and how they can enhance my personal knowledge management process. I'm sure there are many other good ideas, and I'd love to hear about the tools you're using and how they shape your thinking. Thank you for watching until the end, and I hope to see you in my next video! [* ](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec)

that let me take one step back](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=196) [and just share a couple of thoughts](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=199) [about audio books because in the past](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=200) [you asked me one month ago even I would](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=204) [have said that audio books are fantastic](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=206) [for fiction if it's narrated Val it can](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=210) [be a super immersive experience but when](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=213) [it comes to non fiction it comes to](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=216) [technical books business books self-](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=219) [Health books I found that audio books](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=221) [are useless the more abstract the topic](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=225) [the harder it is to concentrate to an](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=229) [audio book and I found that I may listen](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=232) [to an audio book on a topic but by the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=235) [end I have Absol absolutely no](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=237) [recollection of what the book was about](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=240) [maybe I can talk for five minutes about](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=242) [the book but ask me any detail and it's](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=246) [gone I I I couldn't capture it in my](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=249) [mind and my advocacy has been that if](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=253) [you're reading something non-fiction](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=257) [then get a copy of the book either a](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=259) [physical book or a Kindle do your](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=261) [highlights import the highlights into](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=265) [your note taking system go go through a](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=267) [process like Progressive summarization](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=270) [create illustrations book on AAS](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=273) [summaries integrate the knowledge into](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=276) [your other notes and then you will](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=278) [internalize it and now with the extended](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=281) [mind I'm experimenting with a new](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=287) [workflow and I think it is really](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=290) [working very well the workflow is very](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=292) [simple all I do is as I read I have Chad](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=296) [GPT open on my phone so I'm listening to](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=300) [the book on Audible on my phone and I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=303) [have the Chad GPT app also open on my](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=307) [phone and after about 5 to 10 minutes of](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=311) [listening to a chapter I pause the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=316) [chapter and I head over to CAD GPT and](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=318) [start an interactive voice conversation](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=322) [where I share some of my reflections](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=325) [with Chad GPT](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=328) [and then we have a short](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=330) [discussion I explained to CAD GPT that I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=333) [don't want long conversations I'm using](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=336) [it more as a reflective notebook but](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=339) [equally in some cases the feedback I'm](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=343) [getting from CAD gbt helps me fine tune](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=346) [the ideas I have or helps me articulate](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=351) [those ideas better especially as I'm not](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=354) [a native speaker for me um having that](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=358) [additional help to articulate my ideas](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=362) [properly helps and so that's essentially](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=366) [the workflow that as I go through the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=370) [book I pause](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=372) [every every few minutes whenever there's](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=375) [an interesting idea or it triggers an](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=377) [idea I note down connections to My Vault](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=380) [so for example here I'm noting down a](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=384) [connection to um Thinking Fast thinking](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=387) [slow and system to thinking but I have](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=391) [some other links mentioned as well and](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=394) [what I'm like here you can see I'm](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=398) [referencing The Tipping Point so and the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=400) [way I'm using GPT here is as a](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=404) [reflective partner who's able to](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=408) [summarize at the end so the important](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=410) [thing here is when I get to the end of](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=413) [all of this I as GPT to create a summary](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=416) [for me yeah it's somehow here here you](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=420) [go so here's the summary and then](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=422) [in obsidian I add this summary so you](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=426) [can see here I imported this summary so](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=429) [I don't import chapter highlights I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=433) [don't import anything from the book all](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=435) [I do is I import the summary of my](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=439) [conversation with GPT into my note in](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=443) [obsidian and then then I flip this note](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=448) [around if you don't understand what](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=451) [flipping a note around is I'm going to](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=452) [link a video in the description that](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=454) [explains the two-sided notes I flip this](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=457) [note around and on the other side of the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=460) [note I created the illustration that we](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=464) [discussed with](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=467) [GPT there are a couple of practical](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=470) [learnings along the way that I wanted to](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=473) [share so learning number one is when I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=475) [speak for a long time so if I if I'm](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=479) [doing Reflections and it's a longer](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=482) [reflection then GPT has a tendency of](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=485) [interrupting me but what I also learned](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=489) [is if I press and hold the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=492) [screen then GPT will not respond until I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=494) [let go of the screen so that's a great](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=499) [way of reflecting and not feeling that](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=502) [I'm under time pressure and need to](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=505) [continually talk that's a great](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=507) [approach the second learning I took away](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=510) [is if I sit at the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=514) [computer and I do the same process I get](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=517) [distracted I listen to the book and then](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=520) [I think I can multitask and I start to](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=523) [browse the net and there it goes the the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=525) [the the experience is gone so for doing](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=529) [this process I recommend that you do](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=532) [something as you do this you pace around](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=535) [your room you go go for a walk in the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=538) [park I even did this during driving](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=540) [because essentially listening to an](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=544) [audio book and then chatting with GPT](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=546) [that doesn't really require my attention](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=549) [on the phone and if you're driving in](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=551) [city traffic you're standing anyway in](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=554) [line or at the traffic light you have](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=557) [plenty of time to use these tools so I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=560) [found that for this at least for me for](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=565) [this work flow to work I need to be](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=569) [engaged in some activity that the that](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=571) [prevents me from wandering off in other](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=577) [directions then the third learning I had](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=582) [is when GPT creates the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=586) [summary I recommend doing the summary](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=589) [immediately after you finish the chapter](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=592) [so don't go from chapter to chapter to](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=595) [chapter to chapter but at the end of](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=597) [each chapter create the summary import](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=600) [it into your notetaking system create](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=603) [the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=606) [illustration and then move on to the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=607) [next chapter this is going to help you](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=609) [solidify what you've read so far as well](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=612) [as](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=616) [then the ideas are still fresh in your](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=617) [mind so I did find that sometimes GPT](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=620) [excluded things from the summary that I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=623) [thought were important or included new](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=626) [ideas that I didn't say and I'm sure](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=628) [that if I had imported those summaries](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=632) [couple of days later I would have not](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=635) [remembered so reviewing gpt's output](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=637) [fresh](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=641) [immediately is I think uh](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=642) [very helpful or it's a good idea to do](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=645) [and the fourth best practice or at least](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=649) [my practice is I started a new chat for](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=652) [each chapter so if I come here you can](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=656) [see that for each chapter uh thinking](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=659) [with build spaces Sensations movement](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=662) [space of ideas natur Etc I have a](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=665) [separate chat and at the beginning of](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=669) [each chat I have this short explanation](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=671) [to GPT that I'm listening to the book](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=674) [I'm taking mental notes I don't want](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=677) [long conversations I rather just want to](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=679) [use it as a note taking tool and I'll](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=681) [prompt it when I want to](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=684) [discuss and this way I can segre at each](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=686) [of the chapters for me it's just easier](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=690) [to handle it doesn't become one long](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=693) [conversation and also I can avoid things](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=696) [spilling over from one chapter to the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=700) [other so these are then more segregated](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=703) [conversations but yeah so that's the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=706) [first workflow and I think this is super](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=708) [super super powerful I very much enjoy](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=712) [doing this I don't have a GPT](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=716) [subscription deson so I'm using the free](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=718) [version and it is good enough for me and](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=720) [the workflow works so I think this is](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=725) [really an easy thing to do you don't](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=728) [need any subscriptions grab an audio](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=730) [book and try this workflow I promise you](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=733) [this is going to be a new experience](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=737) [that will change the way you think about](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=739) [reading one final thought and that links](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=742) [back to thinking with movement from](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=745) [Murphy Paul and the basic idea is that](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=749) [as a species we were evolved to move and](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=753) [thinking still and concentrating is not](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=757) [natural not our natural strength and I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=763) [think there's an interesting dilemma](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=767) [here because reading you can only do](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=770) [sitting down because if you move the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=773) [letters move it it's almost impossible](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=775) [to read while walking or at least you](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=777) [will read much slower and walk slower](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=781) [it's going to be very inefficient in](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=784) [both ways](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=786) [so I think the additional value of this](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=788) [new workflow that I'm doing is indeed](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=792) [I'm able to bring in the element of](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=795) [motion in how I'm](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=799) [reading and Murphy Paul explains that](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=801) [motion has lots of positive effects on](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=805) [our cognitive abilities so in that sense](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=808) [I think if you go for a walk in the park](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=812) [especially so I think thinking with](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=816) [natural spaces explains how parks are](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=819) [much better for thinking than built](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=823) [spaces like](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=826) [cities if you go for a walk in a park](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=827) [and you listen to the audio book and you](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=831) [talk with chpt on your notes I think](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=833) [you're going to have a super immersive](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=836) [reading](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=839) [experience now on to the other workflow](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=841) [I want to share with you and the other](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=845) [workflow let me show you the output that](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=847) [I was able to generate with that](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=850) [workflow so you can see this mind map is](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=852) [a mind map of all the different benefits](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=856) [and facets of visual thinking so this is](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=861) [um a whole host of uh](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=865) [ideas about the different types and](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=869) [tools for visual thinking as well as the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=873) [different benefits and use cases for](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=876) [visual thinking this is a huge mind map](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=879) [by the way if you want to access this](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=882) [mind map I'm going to include a link in](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=884) [the video description I've posted it](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=888) [here on the visual thinking Workshop](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=890) [website there's a podcast to this and](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=893) [I'm going to get to that in a second you](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=896) [can download the pod](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=898) [podcast as well as I have the exol](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=899) [drawing right here so you can explore](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=902) [this as well as if you want you can save](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=905) [it as a file to your own exol draw](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=907) [environment and you can rearrange this](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=911) [mind map and use it as your input as](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=913) [well as I included all these different](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=916) [book covers here so if a topic interests](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=919) [you you these are the books that you can](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=921) [uh purchase to explore that topic](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=924) [further so this can also be a very](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=927) [good starting point uh to explore the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=930) [idea of visual thinking but in terms of](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=934) [the workflow of how I got to](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=937) [this I used this tool called notebook](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=940) [LM and what I did was I imported all](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=944) [the books and notes I have around visual](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=950) [thinking into notebook LM so this is now](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=955) [everything that I've read and come](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=960) [across](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=962) [regarding visual thinking and then I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=964) [went through couple of rounds of prompts](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=966) [so let me show you my workflow here uh](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=969) [this is the overall workflow that I went](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=972) [through so I uploaded my books to](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=975) [notebook LM then I generated a podcast](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=978) [overview you can prompt notebook alen](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=981) [with a podcast so here if I delete this](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=983) [podcast then you will see that I can](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=987) [customize my podcast prompt and I can](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=990) [just add whatever I have a limitation of](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=993) [500 characters but I can guide notebook](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=996) [LM on the prompt and I think if I come](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1000) [back](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1003) [here this was my final prompt uh so this](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1004) [these were the 500 characters that I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1009) [used to generate the podcast that you](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1012) [find here on the VIS ual thinking](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1016) [Workshop website so this](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1019) [podcast so I uploaded my podcast here](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1022) [and](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1026) [then and](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1028) [then once I was happy with the podcast I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1030) [downloaded the podcast from um notebook](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1034) [LM I converted it with audicity audacity](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1038) [to MP3 so I can import it into my](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1042) [obsidian Vault and then it's not too big](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1047) [of a file so this is my podcast and then](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1050) [I also used notebook LM to transcribe](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1053) [the file so the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1058) [downloaded podcast what I did with the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1060) [downloaded podcast is here I clicked on](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1063) [ADD source and I pasted I dragged in](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1066) [here the downloaded audio file and that](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1070) [creates a so this is now the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1074) [transcription of its own podcast and so](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1077) [all I did was I copied this podcast from](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1081) [here into my note in obsidian so you can](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1084) [see here that here's my podcast](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1089) [transcript and then I also saved this](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1092) [podcast transcript in a file and I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1095) [headed over to Chad GPT and I uploaded](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1099) [my podcast here and I asked it to create](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1103) [a mermaid mind map of this podcast](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1106) [returning the results in a Cod block it](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1109) [first created a mind map but](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1113) [unfortunately obsidian excolo or exol in](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1115) [processing mermaid doesn't handle mine](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1119) [maps well so then I went and asked GPT](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1122) [to change this into the flowchart type](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1126) [of mermaid chart and all I did was I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1129) [copied this mermaid chart to the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1132) [clipboard and went over to to exol draw](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1136) [and in excal draw](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1140) [here under more tools there's the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1142) [mermaid to exol draw feature so I came](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1146) [here and pasted my chart in here it was](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1149) [actually a top down chart so this is how](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1153) [it looked first but I changed top down](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1157) [to left right and I inserted this in](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1160) [here and then of course I did some](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1165) [tweaks I changed the color to white I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1167) [changed the line to Sharp instead of](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1171) [rounded and I did this that I selected](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1175) [some of the branches like this one here](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1178) [I grouped all the elements and then I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1181) [flipped it horizontally like this and so](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1185) [I could start to move these items to the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1188) [to the right or to the left so it became](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1194) [more of a Mappy thing and then of course](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1197) [as I was then reading the page so let me](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1201) [delete this here and show you what I did](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1205) [so I split so first let me change to](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1207) [markdown View mode here I selected to](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1213) [split this to the right and on the right](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1216) [hand side I had the Mind map first it](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1219) [was just the Mind map I automatically](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1222) [created that I started to then rearrange](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1225) [and I had the text here and as I read](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1228) [the text I started to create these](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1231) [illustrations now of course each of](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1235) [these book covers are a link to my Vault](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1237) [so this](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1241) [also then is my map of content for](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1242) [visual thinking because if I look at](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1246) [here the back links in obsidian you will](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1249) [see that oh sorry the forward links you](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1252) [will see that these are all the links to](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1256) [the different books I have or maybe I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1259) [can also show you this with EXC brain](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1262) [how this all looks like so you can see](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1265) [here that in exol brain I have all the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1269) [books referenced here one by one and](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1272) [this is a jump off point to then explore](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1275) [each of these books further and some of](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1280) [the topics like for example here I have](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1282) [flow and of course for flow I have my](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1285) [illustration](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1288) [here that continues on anyway this now](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1289) [takes](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1292) [us us on a completely different path](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1293) [that I processed my notes like this I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1297) [did the transcript as I explained by](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1300) [feeding in the material to notebook LM](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1304) [itself and it created me the transcript](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1307) [I generated the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1310) [mermaid outline of my mind map using C](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1312) [GPT and then here this is the last part](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1316) [where I rearranged the branches I was](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1320) [listening to the podcast that was](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1323) [generated I was reading my notes and I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1326) [created these cards for key ideas I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1329) [could go and ask notebook LM so notebook](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1332) [LM can provide you with a podcast but](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1336) [also you can ask questions here to](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1340) [interrogate the documents you have so](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1343) [whenever something was not clear I was](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1345) [able to do further](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1348) [research and all in all with this I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1350) [created this overview of visual thinking](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1353) [that connects all the books all the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1357) [materials I read into one concise](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1359) [overview that is super helpful for me as](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1362) [a jump off point in the future finding](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1366) [information about visual thinking and I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1369) [think this is just such a neat new](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1372) [workflow it creates this external Loop](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1374) [where I have a whole body of knowledge](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1378) [that I then input into notebook LM I get](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1382) [back a](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1386) [rejigged storyline and through that](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1388) [storyline I can look at what I know](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1392) [already from a different perspective it](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1395) [gives me really a different view on the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1398) [subject that I'm already familiar with](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1400) [and that helps me uncover so many new](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1403) [insights and so many new ideas](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1406) [so in a nutshell these are the two](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1409) [workflows I wanted to share with you one](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1412) [listening to audio books and taking](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1415) [mental notes in ch GPT the other is](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1417) [feeding in a body of knowledge to](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1421) [notebook LM generating a podcast](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1423) [downloading the text creating a mind map](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1426) [and then creating this visual](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1429) [integration of the topic that you're](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1431) [familiar with from a completely new lens](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1433) [A New Perspective](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1437) [I think these two workflows are](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1439) [fundamentally changing how I'm working](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1442) [with information and how I'm working](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1445) [with knowledge they link back to visual](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1447) [thinking they help me connect my](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1450) [ideas but they also don't require me](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1453) [sharing all my notes with these tools I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1457) [can be selective in this case I was](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1461) [sharing books and articles not my own](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1463) [notes but external notes with the tool](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1467) [so in that sense I was not sharing any](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1470) [of my private information or very](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1473) [minimal amount of private information to](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1476) [help guide it the same is true with the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1479) [workflow the reading workflow for the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1482) [extended mind of course I was sharing](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1484) [some of my Reflections but I think these](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1487) [Reflections are all very nicely rink](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1491) [fenced within a small top area of the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1495) [book so I I feel that that is much less](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1499) [of a privacy concern than sharing all my](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1503) [notes I recommend that you try these two](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1506) [workflows both of them are free notebook](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1509) [LM is free CH GPT is free and all of](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1512) [these true tools excolo and obsidian is](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1515) [also free tools so I think from a](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1518) [financial perspective there's nothing](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1521) [stopping you from exploiting these tools](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1524) [but there's so much upside I I really](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1527) [don't see much downside to this but I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1530) [see lots of upsides to experimenting](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1533) [these with these workflows and finally](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1537) [I'd love if you could share your](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1539) [workflows in the comments below I](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1542) [continue to experiment and explore AI](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1544) [tools and how they can help my personal](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1549) [Knowledge Management workflow and I'm](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1551) [sure that there are so many other good](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1554) [ideas out there I'd love to hear hear](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1556) [your thoughts and your workflows for](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1558) [example I wouldn't have found notebook](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1561) [LM if Andy from the visual thinking](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1563) [Workshop had not recommended it to me so](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1566) [yeah this is the way you can find stuff](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1570) [that you hear about it from someone and](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1572) [you can then apply it so please in the](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1576) [comments below let me know what](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1579) [workflows you're using what tools you're](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1581) [using how it's shaping your thinking how](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1583) [it's a paradigm shift or maybe not what](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1587) [efficiencies it brings I'm extremely](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1590) [interested so thank you for watching](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1594) [until the end and I hope to see you in](https://youtu.be/eElhD_vUCec?t=1597) [my next
