![Excalidraw-Obsidian 1.6.8: Tray-Mode and Customizable Color Palettes](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c)

# Summary
In this video, the presenter highlights two new features in the latest release of Excalidraw for Obsidian: the tray mode and customizable color palettes. The tray mode allows users to minimize the properties panel for a cleaner workspace, making it easier to draw without distractions, especially on devices with limited screen space. The customizable color palettes enable users to specify and save their preferred colors, which enhances the flexibility and visual appeal of their Excalidraw drawings.

# Key Takeaways
- **Tray Mode**: This feature allows users to toggle the properties panel to a collapsed menu, providing a cleaner interface for drawing without screen clutter.
- **Customizable Color Palettes**: Users can create and save custom color palettes directly in their Excalidraw templates, giving them greater control over the colors they use.
- **Color Palette Requirements**: The color palette must consist of exactly 15 colors for proper functionality; otherwise, default colors will be used.

Hi, I'd like to demonstrate the two new features that come with this new release of Excalidraw for Obsidian. The first of them is the properties panel tray mode, and the way you can invoke it is through the command palette. If you type in "tray," you can toggle the tray mode. When I press this button, you can see that the panel disappeared and it's collapsed into this menu on the left-hand side. This is handy because you can still access the various panels for what you're drawing, but it doesn't clutter your screen. It is sort of a middle way between Zen mode, in which everything disappears from the screen except for this tool box at the top, and between the full view. I think this tray mode is very handy when you want to draw, for example, on an iPad, or you want to just draw without having your screen area covered with the tools, and you can still access those tools, so I think this is a very practical new feature. [* ](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c)

The other feature I want to show you is the customizable color palette. The idea is that you place this customizable color palette into your Excalidraw template, and then you can have your custom colors whenever you need them. First of all, about templates, if you go into Excalidraw settings, then you can set up a template file. This is my template file right here, and now if I change something on this template file, so let's say I change the background color of this and I draw a circle on my template file, then when I create a new drawing, that new drawing will come with that color and with that shape that I have on my template. Now, in this case, this is not extremely valuable to have an ellipse on my template, but what you can do here is if I open up in markdown mode, then you can see the color palette here. I can modify this descriptor of my file, and I can actually replace this, and now I'm just going to be pasting this object here. I can replace the color palette with some custom data, and so you have three types of colors: you have the element stroke, the element background, and the canvas background. In the description to this release on GitHub, I provide you with the default colors for the color palette. You can just leave the color palette empty, and that means the default Excalidraw color palette, but I give it here because you might only want to change a couple of colors here. So for example, in my case, I wanted a transparent element stroke, and I wanted a white element background. For this reason, what I've done is I've taken the standard Excalidraw colors, but I replaced the second color so the first gray with transparent, and I replaced the first gray with white for element background as well as I wanted more vibrant canvas backgrounds and therefore I provided these various colors. This also demonstrates that you can have any valid HTML color code in this field. [* ](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c)

One thing that you need to keep in mind is that the color palette has to be exactly 15 colors; if it's not 15 colors each, then Excalidraw will not accept that and you will get the default colors. Also, keep in mind that you can decide only to change the element stroke or the element background, in which case you can leave the other items out of here. Now, if I come back to my template and I look at the background colors, then you can see that this is now a new set of colors right here, and when I create a new drawing, then that of course comes with these colors, which I think gives you a great freedom in how you can color Excalidraw drawings. [* ](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c)

Now, one final point: I'm also providing this link here in the GitHub release notes. There's this cool online tool; actually, there are many color palette tools. I looked around, and this one looked the most useful. They have a set of pre-built color palettes as well, and if you like a color palette, you can click here to export it. If you export it as code, then you can copy this to the clipboard, and you get the array of colors. You still need to add the hash mark in front of each of these colors, but this is already a very practical way. Of course, you can change these colors, so if I'd like to change this color, then I can actually change it. Now, I don't remember how I changed itâ€”oh yeah, like this. I can change the colors around, so this is a very practical tool to define your own color palette for Excalidraw. So, I hope you like these two new features and enjoy drawing in Excalidraw. Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c)

background so for this](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=192) [reason what i've done is](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=196) [i've taken the standard x-colidra colors](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=198) [but i replaced](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=201) [the second color so the first gray with](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=203) [transparent and i replaced the first](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=206) [gray with white for element background](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=209) [as well as i wanted more

demonstrates](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=222) [that you can have any](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=224) [valid html color code](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=226) [in](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=230) [this field](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=231) [um one thing that you need to keep in](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=233) [mind is that the color palette has to be](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=236) [exactly 15 colors if it's not 15](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=238) [colors each then x color draw will not](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=242) [accept](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=246) [that and you will get the default colors](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=247) [also keep in mind that you can decide](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=251) [only to change the element stroke or the](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=254) [element background in which case you can](https://youtu.be/2v9TZmQNO8c?t=257) [leave the other items out of
