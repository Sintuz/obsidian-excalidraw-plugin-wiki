![Obsidian-Excalidraw 1.8.16 - QoL Improvements: Keyboard Shortcuts](https://youtu.be/9HlipSIzRhc)

# Summary
In this video, the presenter discusses recent quality-of-life improvements made to the Obsidian-Excalidraw application, specifically focusing on updated keyboard shortcuts. These changes were made to enhance compatibility with Mac OS, and while some old shortcuts will no longer function, the new ones promise a better user experience. The presenter highlights various shortcuts and drag-and-drop functionalities that users should adapt to for a smoother workflow.

# Key Takeaways
- Many existing keyboard shortcuts for Visual PKM tools did not function properly on Mac OS, prompting a redesign.
- New shortcuts have been tailored to align better with Obsidian standards, improving usability for Mac users.
- Users will need to relearn some shortcuts and drag-and-drop actions, which now accommodate new functionalities for inserting images and links.

One of the side benefits of the visual thinking workshop is that I get to see how other people use my tools. I get to see what they struggle with, and this is how I learned that many of my clever keyboard shortcuts simply do not work on Mac OS. So, I finally decided to get myself a MacBook, and I did some extensive testing and reworking of all my shortcuts, modifier keys, drag-and-drop actions, etc., to make them work on Mac OS. Additionally, I took the opportunity to rework these shortcuts to better align with Obsidian standards. I'm sorry, there's a side effect to all of this: the old shortcuts no longer work or are going to achieve different outcomes, so you might need to relearn the shortcuts that you use. However, I think the end result is going to be a much smoother, much better Excalidraw experience. So, let's look at some of these changes very quickly. [* ](https://youtu.be/9HlipSIzRhc?t=0)

First of all, let's look at the shortcuts. I'm going to be using the Windows shortcuts; otherwise, I get confused with my fingers. But here on the other side, you can see the equivalent Mac shortcuts. So first, if I control-click a link, that is going to open the page in a new window. If I control and shift-click the link, then it's going to open in the same window. Now, if I control and ALT-click the link, then it's going to open in the panel on the side, and if I hold down the control, ALT, and shift buttons together, then it's going to open in a new window. Additionally, I don't have a markdown file, but if I hold down the control and the Meta or Windows key, then it's going to open the markdown properties. [* ](https://youtu.be/9HlipSIzRhc?t=60)

Now, in terms of drag-and-drop actions, if I'm dragging and dropping from the internet—for example, if I'm dragging items from this page—then by default, if I drag an item, it's going to insert the image with a link to the URL. So, this image is not going to be saved to your Vault; it's going to be placed here with a link to the image on the internet. In this case, this image is now not in my Vault; it's from the internet. Now, if I hold down the control key when I drop the file, then you can see that the tooltip up there says "insert Link." In this case, Excalidraw is going to insert a link to the file. So, if I now let go of the mouse button, then you can see that here I have a link to the file itself. [* ](https://youtu.be/9HlipSIzRhc?t=120)

Finally, when I drop this object and hold down the shift button, it is going to import the image to my Vault. This means that this is going to be saved in my attachments folder, and this file is going to be created and stored in my Vault. The benefit of this approach—which is what I usually use—is that even if the file is removed from the internet, I will have a copy of it. Then finally, I want to show you the drag operations from the Obsidian file manager. If I drag a file, then by default, Excalidraw is going to insert a link to the file. However, if I press the shift button, then it is going to insert it as an image embed. If it's a markdown file, then it will be inserted as a markdown embed. [* ](https://youtu.be/9HlipSIzRhc?t=180)

Maybe let me just drag something else. I'm going to drag this image, so if I hold down the shift key, it's going to insert the image itself; if I just simply drag this and let go, it's going to insert the link to the file. I have this additional option to anchor the image size to 100. I have a separate video that explains this about the deconstruction of images and why this is useful. So if I hold down the control and ALT and then let go, then the image is going to be embedded at 100% of its size. Now, a bit of a useful tip when dragging from the file manager is that you first drag it without pressing any keys. Just hold the mouse button and drag, then you apply the shortcut that you want to do. So, I am now pressing the shift key and then I let go of the mouse button, and then I let go of the shift key—that's how you insert the file on Mac OS. [* ](https://youtu.be/9HlipSIzRhc?t=240)

What I experienced is that when I drag a file from external sources, I need to wait a second until the default Mac drop action—with the green background and white plus sign—disappears. Then, I can press my shortcut. So, you might need to wait one or two seconds before your modifier key is recognized by Excalidraw, but with a little practice, I think you will get the hang of it; it feels pretty natural. [* ](https://youtu.be/9HlipSIzRhc?t=316)

So, that's all I wanted to share today. The update seems little because it's only the keyboard shortcuts that changed; trust me, this took me several days of work and lots of hassle working through these keyboards. It is a big change. I hope everything works; I did my best to test it throughout. If you find any issues, please let me know on GitHub, and I'll try to get back to you with an updated release as soon as possible. Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/9HlipSIzRhc?t=379)
