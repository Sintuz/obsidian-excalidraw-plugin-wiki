# Summary
In this video, the speaker summarizes "Emergence" by Stephen Johnson, exploring the concept of bottom-up intelligence and self-organizing systems. The presentation details how complex behavior can emerge from simple rules, supported by examples from nature, cities, and the internet. Additionally, it reflects on the insights gained from a visual thinking workshop centered around the book.

# Key Takeaways
- Emergence is a concept that describes how intelligent behavior and complex systems can arise from simple interactions among individual agents.
- Key principles of self-organization include a critical mass of interactions, feedback loops, and the capability of individuals to gauge and adapt to their environment.
- Real-world examples of self-organization include brain activity, urban development, and online communities, showcasing that intelligence does not always stem from a central authority.

Welcome to my book-on-a-page summary of "Emergence" by Stephen Johnson. This video is going to be slightly more than just a book-on-a-page summary. I want to take the opportunity to reflect on the visual thinking workshop as cohort one is quickly coming to an end. The visual thinking workshop takes the participants through a six-step process of reading a book, creating highlights, processing the literature notes, creating the book on a page, storing the key learnings in your personal Knowledge Management System, and finally showcasing your book on a page. Cohort one selected Stephen Johnson's "Emergence" as the book to read, and this video is my presentation of the book itself. Later on, I will share a couple of reflections from both the book and the workshop itself. [* ](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=0)

The book is about intelligence, personality, and learning that emerge from the bottom up. As I was reading the book, I realized that I myself am a strong believer in the myth of the ant queen, not in the sense of thinking about ant colonies, where I understand that it's a self-organizing organism and the queen doesn't have authority over all the ants, but in terms of my assumption that whenever I see intelligent collective behavior, it implies some kind of centralized authority figure. As it turns out, this is not the case in many of the situations that we face in our lives. This includes our thinking and our brain, the way cities are self-organized, and also online communities and social networks. [* ](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=24)

So let's start by clarifying some basic terms. First of all, let's talk about complexity theory, which was coined by Warren Weaver in 1948. He discussed three different types of systems: simple systems, which involve a couple of variables (these could be, for example, the rotation of planets); disorganized complexity, which involves millions or even billions of elements but can only be described statistically (like the physics of water vaporization or the statistics of accidents on the road); and organized complexity, with a relevant example being how a seed develops into a plant. A fourth category Stephen introduces is emergent complexity without adaptation, exemplified by the intricate crystals formed by snowflakes, which are beautiful but have no function. The book focuses on organized complexity that is able to adapt. [* ](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=60)

There are five principles that enable macro intelligence and adaptability in any self-organizing complex system. First, more is different; a critical mass is required for the colony to make intelligent assessments of its global state. Second, sophisticated macro behavior emerges as the sum of the micro motives through various feedback loops, and yet the individual agents are ignorant of the resulting whole. Third, a high number of random encounters are essential for individuals to gauge and alter the macro state of the system. A very high number of encounters also ensures that the system does not get stuck in a state of local optimum. Fourth, agents must be able to identify patterns in the signals they receive from their peers and the environment. For example, in the case of an ant colony, smelling the pheromones of 50 foragers in the space of an hour imparts information about the global state of the colony. Finally, individuals only need to pay attention to their neighbors; however, through the many encounters and attention to patterns, such local information can lead to global wisdom. [* ](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=129)

Beyond the definitions of complexity theory and the five principles, there are two more concepts to keep in mind. First, complex behavior can emerge from surprisingly simple rules. Think of a swarm of birds; it's amazing to think that with only three simple rules, you can simulate this behavior: rule number one is don't take your friends, meaning fly in a way that you avoid collisions; rule number two is to fly in the same general direction as you see your peers flying; and rule number three is not to get left behind, as doing so might make you an easy target for predators. If you apply these three rules, you will end up with a highly adaptable simulation that moves in a very natural way, like a swarm of birds. [* ](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=200)

The second concept is the principle of feedback loops. An example presented in the book is the scandal that emerged around the Bill Clinton-Jennifer Flowers affair in the early 1990s. As the story goes, ABC News interviewed Bill Clinton and asked him about the affair. The next evening, local news agencies picked up the story, creating a feedback cycle that resulted in a scandal. In self-organizing systems, positive feedback loops and, even more so, negative feedback loops are essential. The balance of these feedback loops maintains homeostasis, which is a very important term whenever we discuss self-organizing systems. [* ](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=275)

Now, let's look at three examples of self-organization networks: our brains, cities, and the internet. First, regarding our brains, Stephen discusses how our brain is composed of millions of neurons connecting with one another, forming positive feedback loops. The absolute refractory period of neurons—where they experience fatigue—acts as a negative feedback loop that maintains brain homeostasis. An important point not covered in the book is an interesting experiment discussed, which shows how we can form self-organizing groups called communities. The theory suggests that we are conscious of our thoughts because we first evolved the capability to imagine the thoughts of others. [* ](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=457)

There's an intriguing experiment involving small children. In this experiment, researchers take a box of Smarties, remove the candy, and replace it with pencils. When an unknowing adult enters the room, the children are asked what the adult will expect to find in the box. Four-year-old children can accurately predict that the adult will expect to find candy, as the outside of the box resembles a Smarties box; the adult is unaware of the candy's removal. Conversely, three-year-old children will assume that the adult also knows the candy has been replaced and cannot distinguish what they know from what the adult knows. This experiment demonstrates that between the ages of three and four, we develop the capability to simulate others, which is a core ability for acting in self-organizing systems. [* ](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=577)

The second set of examples discussed in the book is cities. At the time of writing, Stephen Johnson was reading "The Death and Life of Great American Cities" by Jane Jacobs. In her book, Jacobs talks about the importance of sidewalks as the play sphere for city life, where neighborhoods form through information exchange and behavioral adaptation. For example, neighborhoods of businesses form as butchers gravitate to one area, lawyers to another, and artists to yet another. This happens as the business looks for a location with a customer base while avoiding too much competition. Neighborhoods remain stable over time; even in cities several hundred years old, while the buildings and streets change, the neighborhoods tend to remain stable. So, neighborhoods formed by these simple rules become a lasting part of the city. [* ](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=639)

Stephen provides the example of Manchester City in the early 1800s, when it swiftly transformed from a small town into a big city without central governance. Yet, despite this rapid growth, neighborhoods emerged in a self-organizing manner. The takeaway is that cities are powerful examples of self-organization. Interestingly, while individuals can interact with about 50 different people, we tackle the challenge of organizing larger groups—cities of hundreds of thousands or millions—by forming groups within groups and neighborhoods. This process allows us to engage with a much larger group of people. [* ](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=757)

The final examples involve the internet. Stephen mentions the community site Slashdot, which emerged in the late 1990s. As the site grew, negative content became amplified, making quality content difficult to find. To address this, the creator established a karma system. Moderators, selected from the community, could rate articles, creating a feedback system where ratings affected both articles and authors. This points to the necessity of feedback systems in online communities, as they allow the silent majority to express their opinions, preventing a downward spiral of negative content that could hurt community function. [* ](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=813)

Stephen also discusses individuals who doubted that online auctions could succeed, pointing to eBay as an example. Over time, auction sites have developed feedback loops that help users differentiate between fraudsters and legitimate sellers. Additionally, Stephen talks about computer games that illustrate self-organization, citing "SimCity" as a simulation that teaches us about how self-organizing systems work. [* ](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=956)

Where does all this lead us? Stephen suggests we should cultivate environments where solutions can emerge. Problems like city traffic represent organized complexity best addressed with bottom-up solutions rather than top-down directives. He concludes the book with the concept that we need to embrace the unpredictable, acknowledging that the emergent behaviors of self-organizing systems are often hard to forecast. By seeking solutions from the ground up, we risk not fully knowing the potential outcomes. [* ](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1014)

Now, let's discuss some reflections on the book. One reflection revolves around how to apply these concepts in corporate environments. Can corporate systems adopt a more self-organizing, "ant-like" nature instead of relying solely on command economies? During the workshop, another participant brought up the book "Management 3.0," which provides valuable insights for complex projects. Additionally, I considered agile methodologies, such as the "Spotify model," in connection with self-organizing principles. [* ](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1083)

Another question I pondered is how to make my personal Knowledge Management System emerge effectively. I plan to create a separate video on this topic, but it has spurred thoughts on applying the concept of emergence to foster the development of ideas within my system. [* ](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1150)

Finally, regarding the workshop itself, I would like to share some thoughts. One aspect that stood out was how effective Discord was as an online classroom. Additionally, the workshop felt akin to a book club; the collaboration and input from the team enhanced my understanding of the book far beyond what I could achieve by reading it alone. [* ](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1182)

That is the summary I wanted to share with you today. If you are interested, I still have some places available in cohort two, which starts in January. Please check the description and consider joining the visual thinking workshop. Otherwise, I hope to see you in my next video. Thank you! [* ](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1230)

[book Stephen goes into a discussion](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=471) [about how our brain is formed of](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=472) [millions of neurons connecting to

of neurons the fatigue of neurons](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=483) [acts as a negative feedback loop and how](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=486) [all of this important to keep the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=490) [homostasis of the brain however the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=492) [point I want to highlight here so this](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=496) [is not covered on the book on a page the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=498) [point I want to cover here is a very](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=501) [interesting experiment that is discussed](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=504) [in the book and that is about us being](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=507) [capable of forming](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=511) [self-organizing groups called](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=513) [communities and the theory suggests that](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=516) [we are only conscious of our own](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=520) [thoughts because we first evolved the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=522) [capacity to imagine the thoughts of](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=525) [others](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=527) [so in the human brain there's a big](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=528) [simulation running all the time and in](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=531) [this simulation we are simulating how](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=534) [others might think and act in a certain](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=537) [situation and we adapt our own behavior](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=540) [based on the result of that simulation](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=543) [there's an interesting experiment that](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=546) [was done with small children in the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=549) [experiment the children see as the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=552) [researchers take a box of Smarties they](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=555) [remove the candy from the box and they](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=558) [put pencils in the box and then close](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=561) [the box and put it on the table and then](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=563) [an unknowing adult comes to the room and](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=566) [the children are asked what the adult](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=569) [will expect to find in the Box](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=571) [four-year-old children are able to](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=575) [accurately predict that the adult will](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=577) [expect to find candy in the box since](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=581) [from the outside the box looks like a](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=584) [smarties box and the adult doesn't know](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=587) [that previously the researcher has](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=589) [replaced the candy with pencils however](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=592) [three-year-old children will respond in](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=596) [exactly the opposite way they will](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=599) [assume that the adult also knows that](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=602) [the candy was replaced and they cannot](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=605) [make the distinction of what they know](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=608) [and what the adult knows so this is an](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=610) [example or an experiment that](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=614) [demonstrates how between the age of](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=616) [three and four we developed the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=618) [capability to simulate others which is a](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=621) [core capability for us to be able to act](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=625) [in communities to be able to act](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=629) [self-organizing systems](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=634) [the second group of examples discussed](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=637) [extensively in the book involved cities](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=639) [apparently Stephen Johnson was reading](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=642) [the death and life of Great American](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=645) [cities by Jane Jacobs at the time of](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=647) [writing this book and in her book Jane](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=650) [Jacobs talks about the importance of the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=653) [sidewalk as the play smear City Life](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=656) [happens and their neighborhoods are](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=660) [foreign because it is on the sidewalk](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=662) [where people can exchange information](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=664) [with one another and can adapt their](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=666) [behavior](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=669) [for example there's a discussion about](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=671) [how businesses and neighborhoods of](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=673) [businesses are formed this is how](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=676) [butchers will end up in one part of town](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=679) [lawyers and the other artists in the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=682) [third part of town the process is pretty](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=684) [simple the business will look for a](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=687) [location where there's already a group](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=690) [of customers who are interested in their](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=692) [business however on balance they don't](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=695) [want to be too close to other businesses](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=698) [to avoid too strong competition and](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=700) [through these Simple Rules neighborhoods](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=704) [get formed the interesting thing is that](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=706) [neighborhoods are very stable over time](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=709) [so when you take a city that is several](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=712) [hundred years old then what you will](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=715) [find is that the buildings have changed](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=717) [of course people have changed the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=720) [streets have changed but the general](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=722) [neighborhoods stay amazingly stable so](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=724) [once these neighborhoods are formed they](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=729) [they become a stable part of the city](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=731) [the other example that is discussed in](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=736) [the book is the example of Manchester](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=738) [City in the period of the early 1800s](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=740) [Manchester went through a period of](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=744) [rapid growth growing from a small town](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=747) [into a big city in all of this period](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=751) [there was really no Central governance](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=754) [or control over how the city crew but](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=757) [still in this period automatically](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=760) [neighborhoods emerged in a](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=764) [self-organizing manner](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=766) [so the point is that cities are examples](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=768) [of self-organization and the interesting](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=772) [point here is that while on an](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=775) [individual's level we are capable of](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=778) [interacting and knowing about 50](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=782) [different people so that is the size](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=785) [limitation of a community](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=788) [we solve the problem of organizing](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=790) [larger groups of cities of hundred](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=793) [thousands or millions of people by](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=796) [forming groups within groups and forming](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=799) [neighborhoods and through this process](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=802) [we are able to interact with a much](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=804) [larger group of people](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=807) [the final set of examples involves the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=809) [internet and Stephen talks about couple](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=813) [of different examples here first of all](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=816) [he talks about Slash knot which is a](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=818) [community site that emerged at the end](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=821) [of the 1990s as the site grew and the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=825) [number of participants grew there was a](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=829) [problem that content on the site and](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=832) [that was because some negative content](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=834) [got over Amplified it was hard to find](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=837) [quality content because the silent](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=841) [majority could not intervene with the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=844) [more violent minority and that resulted](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=847) [in a negative overall tendency for the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=851) [site and at that time the creator of](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=854) [slashdot decided to create a Karma](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=857) [system his approach was to assign the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=860) [role of moderator always to a different](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=863) [person in the community or a group of](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=865) [different people in the community unity](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=868) [and when you had the right of being a](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=870) [moderator you got a finite number of](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=873) [karma points that you were able to](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=877) [assign to articles and you could give an](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=879) [article minus one to plus five points](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=882) [through the point system these articles](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=885) [got rated the better rating an article](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=889) [and an author had that increased the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=892) [karma of the author and also because as](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=895) [a moderator your role was only temporary](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=899) [and everyone got a chance to be a](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=901) [moderator over time this became a](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=904) [feedback system the reason Stephen](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=907) [mentions this is because in case of](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=910) [online communities we need feedback](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=912) [systems like a Karma system otherwise](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=915) [the silent majority cannot voice their](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=918) [opinion and there's going to be this](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=922) [positive feedback cycle of negative](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=925) [content as a result of these communities](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=928) [will not work and ever since then I](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=931) [think if you think of the different](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=935) [Community sites that you participate in](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=936) [today so remember this book was written](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=939) [20 years ago you can see that similar](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=941) [Karma or rating systems have become](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=944) [pretty much the standard of the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=947) [community sites](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=950) [the second example he mentions is the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=952) [Skeptics who did not believe that Online](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=956) [Auctions would ever work I'm putting](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=960) [here eBay as an example but you can](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=963) [think of other auctioning sites as well](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=965) [where time has proven that Online](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=968) [Auctions work and they work exactly](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=971) [because of the same approach as the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=974) [online communities work because over](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=977) [time these auctioning sites have](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=980) [developed feedback loops that helps](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=982) [users identify frauds from real dealers](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=985) [finally Steven also talks extensively](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=989) [about different computer games that are](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=992) [more self-organizing and generative in](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=995) [nature and one example he talks about is](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=999) [SimCity and how a simulation like](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1002) [SimCity can help us understand the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1005) [self-organizing systems and how they](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1010) [work](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1012) [so where does all of this lead us](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1014) [I think what Stephen is highlighting is](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1018) [we should create an environment where we](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1021) [let Solutions emerge and problems such](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1023) [as City traffic are typical problems of](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1027) [organized complexity that are best](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1031) [tackled bottom up instead of top-down](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1033) [Solutions and he closes his book with](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1037) [this idea that we need to embrace the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1040) [unpredictable and hear the point is that](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1044) [the emerging higher level behavior of a](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1048) [self-organizing system is impossible to](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1052) [predict or extremely hard to predict and](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1056) [therefore by looking for solutions that](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1060) [are not top-down Solutions but bottom-up](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1063) [self-organizing emerging solutions they](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1066) [always carry the risk that you

I](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1075) [hope you like that now let's talk a bit](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1080) [about some of my Reflections on the book](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1083) [so one set of Reflections is a question](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1086) [how can I apply this in my business](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1089) [environment in corporate life can](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1093) [somehow corporate systems be more](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1096) [ant-like self-organizing instead of](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1100) [comment economies](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1103) [here](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1105) [I'm not going to dive deep into this](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1107) [just want to mention that in the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1110) [workshop one of the other participants](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1113) [mentioned the book management 3.0 so I](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1116) [have this pamphlet for complex projects](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1119) [from there and the other example that](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1122) [came to mind are the agile communities](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1125) [and organizing the Spotify way so these](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1128) [are some connections I created and here](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1131) [you can see management 3.0 as the book](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1133) [mentioned and then the other question](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1136) [that came to mind as I was thinking](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1139) [about the book and creating my permanent](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1143) [notes is how can I make my own personal](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1145) [Knowledge Management System emergent and](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1149) [I'm not going to dive deep into this I](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1153) [think I'm going to have a separate](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1156) [dedicated video on the subject but I](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1158) [started to think about ways to apply the](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1161) [idea of emergence to my own personal](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1165) [Knowledge Management System to](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1169) [facilitate the process of emerging ideas](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1172) [from my system](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1176) [and finally about the workshop I just](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1179) [wanted to share a couple of thoughts and](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1182) [these are also topics that I'm going to](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1184) [create dedicated videos on one Discord](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1186) [as an online classroom has proved to be](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1190) [very effective](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1193) [and second](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1195) [the workshop felt like a book club it](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1196) [was an amazing theme and amazing input I](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1200) [just loved how I learned much more about](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1204) [the book through working with the team](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1207) [than reading the book alone myself](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1210) [so that is the summary that I wanted to](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1213) [share with you today and if you're](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1216) [interested I still have some places left](https://youtu.be/4GTh0A6fp7U?t=1219) [in cohort 2 starting in January
