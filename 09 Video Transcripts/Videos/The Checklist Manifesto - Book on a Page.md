![The Checklist Manifesto - Book on a Page](https://youtu.be/0jie6M_MFqQ)

# Summary
The video discusses "The Checklist Manifesto," emphasizing the importance of utilizing checklists in complex fields like medicine to reduce errors and enhance patient safety. By illustrating the successes of implementing checklists in surgical settings, the video highlights how such simple tools can drastically lower rates of complications and save lives. The presenter argues that checklists not only help in managing tasks but also in improving communication and teamwork among professionals.

# Key Takeaways
- Checklists can help prevent avoidable deaths and complications in complex tasks, particularly in medicine.
- The success of checklists in various industries, like aviation and construction, shows their potential in enhancing safety and coordination.
- Effective checklists are concise, focused on critical tasks, and should facilitate team communication rather than overwhelm the user.

The U.S. alone has 150,000 deaths following surgery each year. This is more than triple the number of road traffic fatalities. Research has consistently shown that at least half of these deaths and major complications are avoidable. [* ](https://youtu.be/0jie6M_MFqQ?t=0)

At the forefront of this issue is a surgeon who's passionate about improving these statistics. In his book, "The Checklist Manifesto," he makes the case that as simple as checklists might sound, they can be a strategy for overcoming failure. They build on the experience and knowledge of people but somehow also make up for our inevitable human inadequacies. [* ](https://youtu.be/0jie6M_MFqQ?t=21)

To understand how failure can lead to fatality, consider the following: when was the last time you went on a business trip, and it was only at the hotel or the airport that you remembered you forgot your toothbrush at home? It wasn't because you didn't understand the importance of dental hygiene, but because you were distracted and forgot to pack it. Similarly, in medicine and surgery, simple mistakes can lead to fatalities, such as forgetting to administer the right antibiotics at the right time before surgery or neglecting to wash hands before placing a catheter. [* ](https://youtu.be/0jie6M_MFqQ?t=49)

So, why do people fail? There are two reasons: ignorance, meaning that we only have a partial understanding of the world, and ineptitude, meaning that while the knowledge exists, we fail to apply it correctly. In both cases, checklists can serve as a successful tool. Medicine today is extremely complex; think of an intensive care unit. On average, 178 actions are performed on an individual daily. So how do you ensure that all these are done correctly despite all the distractions? [* ](https://youtu.be/0jie6M_MFqQ?t=101)

We seem to be obsessed with having great components: the best devices, the best drugs, the best specialists, but pay little attention to how to make them fit together. A tool looked to two other industries—the aviation and construction industries—for references because these industries have managed to achieve an outstanding track record of safety. Checklists were invented after the Boeing Model 299 test flight crashed because it was too complex for one person to fly. The solution that finally addressed the challenge didn't require pilots to undergo longer training; they created a pilot's checklist. [* ](https://youtu.be/0jie6M_MFqQ?t=142)

However, it is far from obvious that something as simple as a checklist could be of substantial help in a complex situation. Professionals are tempted to believe that their jobs are too complex to reduce to a checklist. In a complex environment, experts need to deal with two main difficulties: the availability of human memory and attention, especially concerning mundane routine matters that are easily overlooked, and people's ability to lull themselves into skipping steps even when they remember them. [* ](https://youtu.be/0jie6M_MFqQ?t=202)

In one experiment to reduce central line infections at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Peter Pronovost decided to give checklists a try. He created a checklist with five simple steps to avoid infections when putting in the central line and authorized nurses to stop doctors if they saw them skipping a step on the checklist. A year later, they found that the line infection rate went from 11 to zero. In that one hospital, the checklist prevented 43 infections and eight deaths and saved two million dollars by providing a cognitive net to catch mental flaws of memory and attention.

Have you ever wondered how hundreds of people are able to build a skyscraper that stands up straight even in an earthquake? How can the workers be sure they are constructing it properly? How can they ensure they have the right knowledge and that they are applying it correctly? In the past, master builders designed, engineered, and oversaw the construction, but by the middle of the 20th century, the master builders were gone. The variety and sophistication of advancements in every stage of the construction process had overwhelmed the abilities of any individual to master them. [* ](https://youtu.be/0jie6M_MFqQ?t=299)

Construction companies use two main tools to manage complexity. The construction schedule is a line-by-line, day-by-day listing of every building task that needs to be accomplished, in what order and when. It is drawn up by a group of people representing each of the many trades, and it is like a succession of day-by-day checks. The submit or schedule is also a checklist that specifies communication tasks. Project managers deal with the unexpected by making sure that experts speak to one another and take one another's concerns into account when discussing unplanned developments and agreeing on the way forward in a situation. [* ](https://youtu.be/0jie6M_MFqQ?t=348)

To resolve complex problems, you have to ensure that the critical people talk. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, everyone was waiting for the government to step in, but a centrally controlled solution was not going to work. Lee Scott, the CEO of Walmart, realized that to handle this complex situation, he could not effectively issue instructions. Instead, he focused on ensuring that people communicated. Under conditions of true complexity, efforts to dictating every step from the center will fail; people need room to act and adapt yet cannot succeed as individuals. What is required is a mix of freedom and the expectation to coordinate. [* ](https://youtu.be/0jie6M_MFqQ?t=405)

At Columbus Children's Hospital, they found that more than one-third of its appendectomy patients failed to get the right antibiotic at the right time. They created a checklist, but getting teams to stop and use the checklist to make it a habit was tricky. The director of surgical administration, who also happened to be a pilot, designed a small metal tent placed over the scalpel, which had the phrase “cleared for takeoff.” This served as a reminder to run the checklist before making the incision, and the surgeon could not start the operation until the nurse gave the okay and removed the tent. This was also a subtle cultural shift, giving the nurse the power to intervene, and in this way, the checklist also had the effect of distributing power. [* ](https://youtu.be/0jie6M_MFqQ?t=454)

There are two types of checklists: do-confirm checklists, where team members perform their jobs from memory and experience often separately, but then they stop and pause to run the checklist to confirm that everything that was supposed to be done was done; and read-do checklists, where people carry out tasks as they check them off, much like a recipe. To ensure that checklists get used, you must define a clear pause point at which they are supposed to be used. Always, the pilot not flying starts the checklist because the pilot flying can be distracted by flight tasks and liable to skip it. [* ](https://youtu.be/0jie6M_MFqQ?t=515)

Checklists must be tested in the real world. Additionally, checklists can facilitate the sharing of new knowledge as failures are investigated and better ways of doing things are learned. Getting the word out is far from assured, and incorporating the changes often takes years. The reason for the delay is usually not laziness or unwillingness; it is often because the necessary knowledge has not been translated into a simple, usable, and systematic form. [* ](https://youtu.be/0jie6M_MFqQ?t=580)

Good checklists are precise, efficient, to the point, and easy to use, even in the most difficult situations. They do not try to spell out everything but provide reminders of the most critical and important steps. Keep your checklist to between five and nine items, focusing on the killer items. Ideally, your checklist should fit on a single page, free of clutter and unnecessary colors. A good checklist should take between 30 to 60 seconds to complete; they are not comprehensive how-to guides but are quick and simple tools aimed at buttressing the skills of expert professionals. [* ](https://youtu.be/0jie6M_MFqQ?t=633)

Finding the balance is difficult; if you cut too much, you won't have enough checks to improve the process, but if you leave too much in, then the list becomes too long to use. You should try to focus checklists to ensure that people communicate and work as a team. Finally, bad checklists are vague and imprecise; they're too long, hard to use, and impractical. They treat people using the tools as incompetent and try to spell out every single step, which can turn people's brains off rather than turn them on. The difference between using a checklist signals the difference between an amateur and a professional. [* ](https://youtu.be/0jie6M_MFqQ?t=685)

Finally, before closing this book on a page summary, I want to bring to your attention some relevant references from recent books that I've read. In "Building a Second Brain," Tiago Forte talks about pre-project and post-project checklists, highlighting that significant results are most often achieved not through complex one-off heroic missions but through simple workflows implemented consistently day in and day out. Checklists can be an engine to deliver these workflows consistently. I hope you found this book on a page summary helpful. I included a link to the book on a page in the video description. Also, in the video description, you'll find a link to my visual thinking workshop course, which focuses on the workflow for creating such book on a page summaries. Thank you for watching until the end. [* ](https://youtu.be/0jie6M_MFqQ?t=739)
