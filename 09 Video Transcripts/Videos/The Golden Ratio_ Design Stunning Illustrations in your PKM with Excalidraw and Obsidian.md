![The Golden Ratio: Design Stunning Illustrations in your PKM with Excalidraw and Obsidian](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s)

# Summary
In this video, the presenter discusses the significance of the Golden Ratio, also known as the Fibonacci Ratio, in design and art. He explains its applications in various fields including photography, web design, and personal knowledge management (PKM) using tools like Excalidraw and Obsidian. Through practical examples, viewers learn how to apply the Golden Ratio for better visual compositions and illustrations.

# Key Takeaways
- The Golden Ratio (approximately 1.618) is a mathematical ratio found in nature, art, and architecture that contributes to aesthetically pleasing designs.
- Practical applications include image cropping, font size scaling, and layout design using the Golden Ratio for enhanced visual appeal.
- Tools like Excalidraw provide scripts to help designers easily create grids and spirals that follow the Golden Ratio, facilitating better design in personal knowledge management.

Hey everyone, Jol here. Do you know what this number is? I should have really paid attention in school and in art class, but I didn't, so I had to relearn this recently. This number is even more important than this one, and this one is the answer to the big question of life, the universe, and everything. The number is sometimes called "fi," or the Fibonacci Ratio, or the Golden Mean, the Golden rectangle; it has many names. But essentially, it is the number that describes our universe. It describes flowers, nature, it describes seashells and even the waves, but also it describes how our body is designed, the proportions of our face and body. You can see it everywhere you look. Also, you can see this in ancient architecture; the Greeks used it, the Taj Mahal uses it throughout, and even in major works of art, you can discover the Golden Ratio or the golden spiral, as it's called sometimes. It's even present in politics and cats even sleep this way. [* ](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=0)

So what is this? Well, the Fibonacci sequence is a simple sequence where you add the number to the previous sum, so you add 1 + 1 = 2, then you add 1 + 2 = 3, then 2 + 3 = 5. You go through this sequence, and if you take the ratio of these numbers‚Äîso you divide 2 by 1, 3 by 2, 5 by 3, 8 by 5‚Äîthis number will converge to approximately 1.618, which is the Golden Ratio. This is also how, roughly, the proportions in the golden spiral are divided. You can see how these numbers, the Fibonacci series, appear as the sizes of these various boxes, and this was rediscovered by Leonardo Fibonacci. Of course, as you saw, the Greeks already used it, so this was well-known knowledge. This is how everything in the universe organizes, how everything looks. [* ](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=45)

So how can you use this? What are some practical use cases for the Fibonacci series? Well, you can use it for image cropping. If you look at well-crafted images, you'll discover that somehow the golden spiral or the golden grid is used. For example, if you take this image and you want to crop it to make it look really nice, then you can actually apply the golden spiral, and based on that, you can make a better cut. Hopefully, you can see that the cut in the top right looks much nicer than the cut where the original cut was on the top left. You can also use this for slime illustrations and thumbnails. So, in the thumbnail for this video, you can see that I actually included the grid as well as the golden spiral, also partly for communications. If you place the golden spiral on top of this, you can see that the items are nicely placed in their right places. Also, you might not see this, but actually, the font size also follows a Fibonacci sequence. We'll look at that in just one second. But of course, I'm not a big artist; I'm not really good at this. I just use tools. Let's look at, for example, this poster. This is an iconic poster, and what a surprise! If you put the golden grid on top of this, everything is positioned perfectly‚Äîthe lady swimming, the text up here, even how it overruns the shark; the nose of the shark, everything is perfectly placed following the golden grid. [* ](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=90)

Now, you can also use this in website design. Here‚Äôs a website, and you will not be surprised, but you can see how within the golden grid you see the buttons, you see the sidebar, you see everything organized following this logic. Also, you can use it for font size scaling. Typically, your normal text heading, heading 2, and heading 3, if it follows the Fibonacci sequence, it will stand out. So that's the story of the number, that's the story of 1.618. Now let me show you the script I've created to help you use this number. Let's create a new drawing. In this drawing, I'm going to first create a rectangle like this, and I'm going to just remove the background color of this rectangle and make the edges sharp. Now I'm going to run the script, but before running the script, I need to install it. So I'm going to click here on install or update script, and I'm going to type in "golden ratio." If I click here, I can simply click install the script. Once the script is installed, I will find it right here in my list of scripts. Here it is, and when I click this, I get this dialog box with lots of options. So let's start with some of the basic options. I'm going to create a grid, and in this case, I'm going to create a grid that is going to be centered out in both of the cases, and I can set how many grid lines I want. I want eight grid lines, and in this case, this is all the setting I‚Äôm going to do. Then I hit run, and my golden grid was created, allowing me to position items using this grid. Now, of course, I can create different looking grids as well. For example, I can create a left-to-right grid only like this and maybe with fewer lines, and then I have this grid that I can use as well. Or if I want a spiral, I can just simply click here to insert a spiral, and I can choose where the spiral should look. I can even create a double spiral. I‚Äôm going to make the spiral bolder, and then I have my double spiral here with the lines displayed. Finally, you can also use this to set text sizes. The way it works is this is my text, and when I click on the text and I run the script, then in this case instead of bringing up the dialog box, it‚Äôs going to size this text in such a way that first it will give me two larger versions and then two smaller versions than the original. This way, I can sequence through different sizes of text. Now, if I want to go larger, then I need to wait two seconds, and after two seconds, if I click this script again then I can go to the larger sizes, so the sequence cycle starts again. So that‚Äôs all I wanted to show you today. There are many options in the script, so if you play with the dialog box, you will see many options. But hopefully this introduction gives you an understanding of how to use the script as well as a reason why to use the script. I recommend that if you‚Äôre not familiar with the golden grid, then you do your research on the internet or on YouTube. It is really fundamental to good design and good knowledge work. Good personal knowledge management depends on excellent illustrations, so I think this is fundamental to PKM. Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=135)

look](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=58) [also you can see this in ancient](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=61) [architecture the Greeks used it the Taj](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=64) [Mahal uses it](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=68) [throughout and even in major works of](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=70) [art you can discover the Golden Ratio or](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=74) [the

[way so what is this](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=87) [well the Fibonacci sequence is a simple](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=90) [sequence where you](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=94) [add the number to the previous sum so](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=96) [you add 1 + 1 = 2 then you add 1 + 2 = 3](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=99) [then 2 + 3 = 5 you go through this](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=105) [sequence and if you take the ratio of](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=109) [these numbers so you divide 2 by 1 3x 2](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=113) [5 by 3 8 by 5 this number will converge](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=117) [to](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=121) [1.618 which is five and which is the](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=124) [golden](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=127) [ratio and this is also how roughly the](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=128) [proportions in the golden spiral are](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=133) [divided so you can see how these numbers](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=137) [the Fibonacci series appears as the size](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=139) [of these various boxes and this was](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=143) [rediscovered by Leonardo Fibonacci of](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=146) [course as you saw the Greeks already](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=150) [used it so this was a wellknown](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=152) [knowledge as well as this is how](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=154) [everything in the universe organizes how](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=157) [everything](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=160) [looks so how can you use this what are](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=162) [some practical use cases for the](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=165) [Fibonacci series well you can use it for](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=167) [image cropping and if you look at well](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=170) [cred images you'll discover always that](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=173) [somehow the golden spiral or the the](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=177) [golden grid is used so for example if](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=179) [you take this image and you want to crop](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=183) [this image to make it look really nice](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=186) [then you can actually apply the golden](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=189) [spiral and based on the golden spiral](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=192) [you can make a better cut so you can](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=196) [hopefully see that the cut top right](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=198) [looks much nicer than the cut the](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=201) [original cut was on the top](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=203) [left you can also use this for slime](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=206) [illustrations and thumbnails so for](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=210) [example in the thumbnail for this video](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=212) [you can see that I actually included the](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=215) [grid as well as the golden spiral also](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=219) [for partly Communications but if you](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=223) [place the golden spiral on top of this](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=227) [you can see that the items nicely plac](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=230) [in their right places as well as you](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=233) [might not see this but actually the font](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=237) [size also follows a Fibonacci Sequence](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=239) [we'll look at that in just one](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=243) [second but of course I'm not a big](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=246) [artist I'm not really good at this I](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=249) [just use tools let's look at for example](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=252) [this poster this is an iconic poster and](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=255) [what a surprise if you put the golden](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=259) [grid on top of this everything is](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=263) [positioned perfectly the lady swimming](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=266) [the text up here even how it](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=269) [overruns the shark the nose of the shark](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=273) [everything is perfectly placed following](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=276) [the golden](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=279) [grid now you can also use this in](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=280) [website design and so for example here's](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=283) [a website and you will not be surprised](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=286) [but you can see how within the golden](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=289) [grid you see the buttons you see the](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=292) [sidebar you see everything organized](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=294) [following this logic](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=297) [also you can use it for font size](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=300) [scaling so typically your normal text](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=303) [heading heading to heading 3 if it](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=307) [follows the Fibonacci sequence it will](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=309) [stand](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=312) [out so that's the story of the number](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=313) [that's the story of](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=317) [1618 and now let me show you the script](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=320) [I've created to help you use this number](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=324) [let's create the new drawing](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=327) [and on this drawing I'm going to first](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=330) [create a rectangle like this and I'm](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=333) [going to just remove the background](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=336) [color of this rectangle and make the](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=338) [edges sharp and now I'm going to run the](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=340) [script but before running the script I](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=344) [need to install it so I'm going to click](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=346) [here on install or update script and I'm](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=349) [going to type in](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=353) [golden ratio and if I click here I can](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=355) [can just simply click install the script](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=359) [once the script is installed I will find](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=362) [it right here in my list of scripts here](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=366) [it is and when I click this then I get](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=370) [this dialog box with lots of options so](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=374) [let's start with some of the basic](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=377) [options I'm going to create a grid and](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=380) [in this case I'm going to create a grid](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=383) [that is going to be Center out in both](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=386) [of the cases and I can set how many grid](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=389) [lines I want I want eight grid lines and](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=392) [in this case this is all the setting I'm](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=395) [going to do then I hit run then my](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=398) [golden grid was created and I can](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=401) [position items using these this grid now](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=404) [of course I can create different looking](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=408) [grids as well so for example I can just](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=410) [create a left to right grid only like](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=413) [this and maybe with fewer lines](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=417) [and then I have this grid that I can use](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=420) [as well or if I want a spiral I can just](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=423) [simply click here to insert a spiral and](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=427) [I can choose where the spiral should](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=431) [look I can even create a double spiral](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=433) [I'm going to make the spiral being more](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=436) [bold and then I have my double spiral](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=439) [here with the lines](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=443) [displayed and finally you can also use](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=445) [this to set text sizes so the way it](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=449) [works is this is my text and when I](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=451) [click on the text and I run the script](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=455) [then in this case instead of bringing up](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=459) [the dialogue box it's going to size this](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=462) [text in such a way that first it's going](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=465) [to give me two larger versions and then](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=468) [two smaller versions than the original](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=471) [and this way I can sequence through](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=474) [Cycles through different C sizes of text](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=477) [now if I want to go larger then I need](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=480) [to wait 2 seconds and after 2 seconds if](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=483) [I click this script again then I can go](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=487) [to the larger sizes so the sequence the](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=491) [cycle starts](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=494) [again so that's all I wanted to show you](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=496) [today there are many options in the](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=499) [script so if you play with the dialogue](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=501) [box you will see the many options but](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s?t=503)
