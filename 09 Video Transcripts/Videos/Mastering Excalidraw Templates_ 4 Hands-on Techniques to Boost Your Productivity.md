![Mastering Excalidraw Templates: 4 Hands-on Techniques to Boost Your Productivity](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A)

# Summary
In this video, the presenter shares four practical techniques for creating and using templates in Excalidraw, especially for crafting worldly maps. Each method is designed to enhance productivity by simplifying the process of inserting and managing templates within Excalidraw and Obsidian. The video emphasizes ease of use and efficiency, helping users leverage the full potential of visual thinking tools.

# Key Takeaways
- **Using the Stencil Library**: Group your drawing elements and add them to the stencil library for easy reuse in future projects.
- **Creating Excalidraw Templates**: Configure templates to replicate specific designs or layouts automatically when creating new drawings.
- **Embedding Images**: Use image embedding for templates that require visual elements, benefiting from linking and tracking instances of these templates across various files.
- **Implementing Templator**: Utilize the Templator community plugin for advanced templating features, including automatic timestamps and custom scripts for enhanced drawing automation.

Hey everyone! Simon approached me with a very interesting question the other day on the visual thinking Workshop Discord server, and I thought I would share the answer with all of you. He wanted to know if it's possible to create templates with Excalidraw; he wants to create worldly maps in particular using this template. So there are four different ways that I'm going to show you in this video; they're all super simple, so hopefully you will find them useful and this will improve your experience with Excalidraw and Obsidian. [* ](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=0)

Option 1 involves using the stencil library. The stencil library is here on the side. If I open it, I already have lots of icons in here, and if I choose an image or a drawing from here, I can just simply click on it, and that is inserted here. By the way, this is an Excalidraw drawing object, so I can go ahead and recolor it if I want to, and I can make changes to it. So this becomes an editable icon that I can reuse anywhere. Let me delete this from here and see how we can add Simon's template to the stencil library. This is the template that Simon shared with me, so let's add this to the stencil library. First of all, I'm going to click Ctrl+A to select all the objects in this drawing, and then I'm going to right-click on this and choose "Group Selection." I'm grouping this object into one item because this way, when I insert it into another drawing, it will be easier to handle this because it won't have the different parts all over the place. [* ](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=4)

Now that it's grouped, I'm going to right-click again and choose "Add to Library," and when I do this, then if I come over here to the stencil library, you can see that this is now in my stencil library. So let's see how I would use this in a drawing. Imagine I have an empty file here; this is an empty Excalidraw drawing, and I want to use the Worldly map template here. So I open the stencil library and I click on this object, and voila! It's inserted. Now, as an additional improvement, I recommend that once you've inserted, click "Lock All" to lock this in here. By locking it, what will happen is when you draw on this, I'm now adding a couple of drawings here, and I select everything. The locked items cannot be selected; they cannot be changed. So they are not going to be in the way, and as you draw here, it will just be as if the template was not there. It's visible, but it's in the background. If for whatever reason I would want to change the template here in this drawing—for example, I want to change the color of the text—I could right-click and select "Unlock," then I could double-click on the item I want to recolor or change, I could do that and then I could again lock it, and when I'm locked, then again it's in the background; it won't be in my way. [* ](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=33)

Now let me delete this from here and let's get back to the empty file. Now, the second way to do this is to use the Excalidraw template. So first of all, you need to go to plugin settings. I opened settings here and I'm going to scroll down to Excalidraw; here at the top of the Excalidraw settings, you will see the setting for the Excalidraw template file. I already have it configured to the template file in my Excalidraw folder, so here I'm going to open this file and using the quick switcher, I'm just going to type in "Template." This is my Excalidraw template file. Now, whatever I put in this template is going to be replicated when I create a new drawing. So I'm going to take the stencil library, I'm going to insert Simon's Worldly map template here, and I'm going to lock this. This is now nicely locked. Now, if I open a new drawing and I click on the "Create New Drawing" ribbon button, then a new file is created, and the new file has my Worldly map, and the Worldly map is not selectable because it's locked. So this way, if I create multiple files, then each of them will come with my template; and I think this approach is excellent if you want some sort of a standard template in your files; maybe you want the grid in the background. This way, you can create it, and whenever you create a new drawing, it will have that grid in there. [* ](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=217)

So now let me delete these files; I don't need this. Also, let me clean up my template file because I actually don't want this in my template, so let me close this and go back to the solutions. Solution number three involves embedding the template as an image. So why would you want to do this? You want to do this if the template includes a picture. For example, imagine that I have a picture here. I'm using the command palette "Insert Image" action to insert an image, and I'm going to insert my brain light bulb icon, and I'm just going to make this smaller and place it here in the corner. So imagine that this is how my Worldly map template looks like now. If I want to reuse this Worldly map template, then I can press Ctrl+P to insert an image, and I can just choose the Worldly map template like this, and with this, this image is inserted. Now, it is good to lock this as well so it's not in the way. So I'm going to click lock, and now this drawing is embedded, and if I draw on top, then it works just the same as the previous option; but now in this case, this is an image. This approach has a hidden benefit—let me know if you can think of what that benefit could be. [* ](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=340)

So the benefit is that if now I come to the template right here and I click on the backlinks, then I will see where this template is used. So for example, imagine that I'm creating an empty drawing here, and again I'm going to insert the image. This time, I'm going to use the Obsidian tools icon and choose the "Insert Image" action. This is exactly the same as in the command palette, and I insert the Worldly map template like this. So I've inserted my Worldly map template here, and I come back to the Worldly map. Then you will see that when I open my Worldly map template file, I already see that this was used in three different files. So this way, I can find all the documents where I'm using this template. [* ](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=493)

So let me clean this up again; we don't need this, and let me delete this from here as well; so I'm cleaning up, and now we are back here. But it is possible to create this linkage also with the stencil library, so you don't necessarily need to insert an image to create this sort of linking. So let me show you how I would do it. So we are now here, adding a hidden tag, or you could add a hidden link as well, so let me show you how that works. So now, I've opened the template file. I'm going to delete the brain icon, but I'm going to add a tag here, and I'm going to add the "Worldly Map" tag. You can see here I've added this Wordly map; this can be as big or small as you want. I'm now adding it big so you can see it on screen, and after I added the Worldly map tag, I'm going to hide this by making it transparent. So I select the text element and I type "transparent" like this, and with that, this text disappeared. Of course, it didn't disappear; it's still here. So if I double-click, it is right there, and it still says "Worldly map," which means that if I open the text pane right here and I scroll down, then I will see the Worldly map here, which has a single instance in my vault, which is of course this template right here. [* ](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=559)

So let me add this to the stencil library. I'm going to right-click and select "Add to Library," and let me come to my demo file and let's add this new second template because this is the one we did the first time; this is the second one with the hidden text. So let me add this to my file. If I double-click here, you will see it has the hidden text. Again, I can lock everything, and then it's not in the way; but if I come over to my text pane, then you will see that there are two Worldly maps here, and if I click on this on the number two, then the search will open and I will see the instances of my Worldly maps right here. [* ](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=617)

So let me again delete this from here, and let's move on to approaching the final approach, which is to use Templator templates. This is going to be slightly more complicated, but it also comes with lots more power. So I think the complicated and the power does pay off. So let's first of all open my template and let's find this in the file navigator, the Obsidian file navigator. So I'm now right-clicking on the tab, and I'm going to click here "Reveal in File Navigation." So when I do this, then it takes me to the template file which is right here. I'm going to make a copy of this file, so I'm right-clicking on this, and I'm going to choose "Make a Copy" because I'm going to be modifying this; I don't want to change the original file, so I click "Make a Copy." Now when I create a copy, it opens in this Excalidraw view mode; don't worry, nothing has happened. You can always click here, right-click on the tab, and open as an Excalidraw drawing, and then it will open as the Excalidraw drawing. I'm going to now right-click here and I'm going to move my file to my tools/templates, so I have—that is my templates folder for Templator. [* ](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=642)

By the way, I should have said this earlier; I’m using a community plugin called Templator. So this is the Templator plugin you can install from community plugins. If you click here on browse and you type in "Templator," then you can simply install it, and you need to configure Templator as well. So here I’m going to scroll down in plug-in settings to Templator, and I’m going to just—you see here, this is my templates folder; this is the tools/templates, so that’s where my Templator templates sit. I’m just going to rename this file so you can see that this is the copy. This was the original, and this is the copy that I moved to the Templator folder. I’m going to again click here to reveal this file in file navigation, and you can see here now I’m in my templates folder, and this is my Worldly map template. Now I’m going to rename this, just simply, I’m going to rename this to "Worldly Map" like this, and I’m going to save this. [* ](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=660)

Now if I want to create a new Worldly map, what I can do is I can open the Templator "Create New Node from Template" action. I have configured Alt+Shift+E as a hotkey, but you don’t need to; I’m clicking on the "Create New Node from Template," and I’m just going to type in "Worldly Map." So I have my Worldly map here; this is the file in the Templator folder. I click on this, and here an untitled file was created, and if I switch to Excalidraw drawing, then it's right here. So this way, you can have multiple templates, not just a simple single template that we set up with the Excalidraw template, but this way if you place multiple drawings or template drawings to your template folder, you can create all of them. I’m going to delete this file; by the way, I could also just create a new empty node. [* ](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=872)

So now I created an empty node and I can again click Ctrl+P, Templator, and I can click "Insert Template Model." This is different; you see this has the Alt+E shortcut, so this applies the template to the file I have opened. So if I click this again, I can choose "Worldly Map," and it’s inserted, and if I switch to Excalidraw view mode, then I have my template in this empty file. I’m going to delete this as well. So far, this is interesting, but this is not yet the end. There are two more things I want to show you which really take the Templator templates to the next level. So first of all, let's just open, so this is my Templator template for Worldly Maps. Let’s add a timestamp on it. So imagine that this is your template and you want to automatically create this template with a date stating the creation date. So how would I do that? What I would do is I would add a text element here, and I’m going to say "Created: " and now I’m going to insert a piece of code here and explain what I’m doing. So I’m going to add a simple Templator script here, and this symbol at the end and at the beginning marks a template or template code. This one right here is a simple JavaScript code to insert today's date, so now my template is ready. [* ](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=930)

So let me now create a new file using this template. So again, I'm going to press Ctrl+B and I'm going to type Templator and I'm going to choose "Create a New Node from Template," and I'm going to choose a Worldly map. Now this file is created, and I'm going to switch to open Excalidraw drawing like this, and you can see that here on top, the template changed to the date today, so the script was executed when I inserted this template. So let me delete this file, and let me just add one more trick. So the additional trick I want to do, first of all, notice that here I’m using the apostrophe symbol and not the quotation mark symbol. So I could have also written the code like this; but then it would not work. I won’t go into the details, but the way the Excalidraw JSON is created in the background, this will then be converted to a backslash quotation mark and the script when Templator tries to run the script will fail. So the point is, you should use the apostrophe here and then your script lines will work fine, so that’s just as a side note. [* ](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1035)

But now the bit that I don’t like about this template is now if I create a new file here, so I’m just going to create again an untitled document. So what I don’t like about this is I’m going to insert my Worldly map that it opens like this, and I still need to click "Open as Excalidraw." I mean, this is not a huge issue, but it would be nicer if it would automatically open as an Excalidraw file. So the good news is this is possible, and it’s actually not that difficult. So now I’m going to switch to the Worldly map template in the Templator folder, and I’m going to switch to Markdown view. [* ](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1092)

Here at the top, above the text elements but below the front matter, I can add whatever I want to my template. So in this case, I’m going to add a short Templator script. So without going into too much detail, what the script is going to do is it's going to execute a command from the command palette. It's going to say, if I open Ctrl+P, I open the command palette; there's a command palette action "Toggle Excalidraw," and toggle between Excalidraw draw and Markdown mode—this is the action that needs to be toggled, and it will just simply execute that four seconds after the file was created. I leave it four seconds so Obsidian has time to process this file and for the command palette action to be available. So let’s see how this works. If I come here and I choose the "Insert Templater Model," and I choose "Worldly Map" and press enter, then after four seconds, this turns over and becomes an Excalidraw drawing. [* ](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1150)

So again, this just automates the way this is created. So if I would now create and I’m going to use now the Ctrl+P, Templator there and I’m going to use the "Create New Note from Template" again, it's going to work the same way. I choose "Worldly Map," I press enter, and I just leave it for four seconds, and after four seconds, it automatically converts into an Excalidraw drawing. And this way, you can see that this drawing has the create date, and it was automatically switched to the Excalidraw view. [* ](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1223)

To recap, adding the template to the stencil library I think is super easy and practical; this would be my number one recommendation. Creating an Excalidraw template is good if you want to use the template on all your files, so for example, adding a grid to that template could be something that is useful. Inserting the template as an image I think is good if your template includes some pictures as well, because those will not fit in the stencil library. But on the back of this, we explored the benefit of having backlinks and finding all the instances of where I’m using the template. By the way, then we had this conversation that if you add a hidden tag as a text element to your template that’s in the stencil library, then you can achieve something pretty similar using the tag pane and Obsidian search. And finally, we looked at the Templator templates. Yes, this is slightly more complicated, but it comes with huge benefits because in this case, you can add things like timestamps, and you can add also custom tags and custom text elements and all sorts of good functions. Through this, you can also, via the facilities provided by Templator, assign hotkeys to different Excalidraw templates. We are not going into those details in this video, but actually doing this sort of templating with Templator opens a whole new world for Excalidraw automation.

I hope you found this video helpful and please let me know if you have other practical problems that you would like to see solutions for, and I'm happy to create other videos that walk through specific use cases and explain how to automate that process using Excalidraw and Obsidian. Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1364)

and voila it's inserted now is an](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=143) [additional Improvement what I recommend](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=147) [you to do is once you've inserted to](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=149) [click lock all to lock this in here and](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=152) [by looking it what will happen is when](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=156) [you draw on this so I'm now adding](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=159) [couple of drawings here and I select](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=162) [everything the logged items cannot be](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=164) [selected they cannot be changed so they](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=167) [are not going to the template is now not](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=169) [going to be in the way and as you draw](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=171) [here then it is just going to be as if](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=174) [the template was not there it's visible](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=178) [but it's in the background if for](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=180) [whatever reason I would want to change](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=183) [on the template here in this drawing for](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=185) [example I would want to change the color](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=188) [of the text I could right click and](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=190) [select unlock and then I could double](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=193) [click on the item I want to recolor or](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=196) [change I could do that and then I could](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=200) [again lock it and when I'm when I've](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=202) [logged it then again it's in the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=205) [background it won't be in my way](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=207) [so now let me delete this from here](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=210) [let's get back to the empty file now the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=213) [second way to do this is to use the X](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=217) [collateral template so first of all you](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=220) [need to go to plugin settings so I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=223) [opened settings here and I'll scroll](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=226) [down to excalator and here at the top of](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=229) [the scholar draw settings you will see](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=233) [the setting X collateral template file I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=235) [already have it configured to the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=239) [template file in my x-colletra folder](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=241) [so here I'm going to open this file and](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=245) [using the quick switcher I'm just going](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=248) [to type in template so this is my](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=250) [excalator template file now whatever I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=253) [put in this template that is going to be](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=256) [replicated then I create a new drawing](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=260) [so I'm going to take the stencil Library](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=263) [I'm going to insert Simon's Wordly map](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=265) [template here and I'm going to lock this](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=269) [so this is now nicely locked](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=272) [and now if I open a new drawing and I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=275) [click here on the create new drawing a](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=279) [ribbon button then](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=282) [a new file is created and the new file](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=284) [has my worldly map and the worldly map](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=287) [is not selectable because it's logged so](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=290) [this way if I create multiple files then](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=294) [each of them will come with my template](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=298) [and this is going to be in my template I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=301) [think this approach is excellent if you](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=304) [want some sort of a standard template in](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=307) [your file maybe you want the Grid in the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=310) [background the custom grid this way you](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=314) [can create it and whenever you create a](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=317) [new drawing it will have that Grid in](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=320) [there](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=322) [so now let me delete these files I don't](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=323) [need this](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=326) [as well as let me clean up my template](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=327) [file because I actually don't want this](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=330) [in my template so let me close this and](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=333) [back to the solutions solution number](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=336) [three involves embedding the template as](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=340) [an image so why would you want to do](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=344) [this you want to do this if the template](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=346) [includes a picture so for example](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=349) [imagine that I have a picture here I'm](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=351) [using the command palette insert image](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=353) [action to insert an image and I'm going](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=357) [to insert my brain light bulb icon and](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=360) [I'm just going to make this smaller and](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=365) [place it here in the corner so imagine](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=367) [that this is how my worldly map template](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=370) [looks like now if I want to reuse this](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=373) [worldly map template](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=377) [then I can press Ctrl P to insert image](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=379) [and I can just choose the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=385) [worldly map template like this and with](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=387) [this this image is inserted now it is](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=392) [good to lock this as well so it's not in](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=396) [the way so I'm going to click lock and](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=399) [now this drawing is embedded and if I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=402) [draw on top then it works just the same](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=406) [as the previous option but now in this](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=409) [case this is an image](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=411) [this approach has a hidden benefit](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=414) [and let me know if you can think of it](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=417) [what that benefit could be](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=420) [so the benefit is that if now I come to](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=423) [the template right here and I click on](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=426) [the bank backlinks then I will see where](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=430) [this template is used so for example](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=434) [imagine that I'm creating an empty](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=436) [drawing here and again I'm going to](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=438) [insert the image this time I'm going to](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=441) [use the obsidian tools icon and choose](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=443) [the insert image action this is exactly](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=447) [the same as in the command palette and I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=449) [insert the Wordly map](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=452) [template like this so I've inserted my](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=455) [Wordly map template here and I come back](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=459) [to the worldly map then you will see](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=461) [that when I open my worldly map template](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=464) [file I already see that this was used in](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=467) [three different files so this way I can](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=471) [find all the documents where I'm using](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=474) [this template](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=476) [so let me clean this up again we don't](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=479) [need this and let me delete this from](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=482) [here as well so I'm cleaning up](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=486) [and now we are back here](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=488) [but it is possible to create this](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=491) [linkage also with the stencil Library so](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=493) [you don't necessarily need to insert an](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=496) [image to create this sort of linking so](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=499) [let me show you how I would do it so we](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=502) [are now here adding a hidden tag or you](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=505) [could add a hidden link as well so let](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=508) [me show you how that works](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=511) [so now I'm again I opened the template](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=514) [file I'm going to delete the brain icon](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=517) [but I'm going to add a tag here and I'm](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=521) [going to add](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=525) [Wordly map tag so you can see here](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=527) [I've added this Wordly map this can be](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=532) [as big or small as you want I'm now](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=534) [adding it big so you can see it on](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=537) [screen and after I added the worldly map](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=539) [tag I'm going to hide this and I'm](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=542) [hiding it by making it transparent so I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=546) [select the text element and I type](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=549) [transparent](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=551) [like this and with that this](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=554) [text disappeared of course it didn't](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=559) [disappear it's still here so if I double](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=561) [click it is right there and it still](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=564) [says Wordly map which means that if I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=566) [open the text pane right here and I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=569) [scroll down then I will see the worldly](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=573) [map here which has a single instance in](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=575) [my vault which is of course this](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=579) [template right here](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=581) [so let me add this](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=582) [to the stencil Library so I'm going to](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=585) [right click and select add to library](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=588) [and let me come to My Demo file and](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=592) [let's add this new second](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=595) [template because this is the one we did](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=599) [the first time this is the second one](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=601) [with the hit and text so let me add this](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=603) [to my file if I double click here you](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=606) [will see it has the hidden text](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=608) [again I can lock everything and then](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=612) [it's not in the way but if I come over](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=615) [to my text pane then you will see that](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=618) [there are two worldly Maps here and if I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=621) [click on this on the number two then the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=624) [search will open and I will see the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=628) [instances of my worldly Maps right here](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=631) [so let me again delete this from here](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=636) [and let's move on approaching the Final](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=639) [Approach which is to use template or](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=642) [templates this is going to be slightly](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=645) [more complicated but it also comes with](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=648) [lots more power so I think the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=651) [complicated and the power does pay off](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=654) [so let's first of all](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=658) [open my template and let's find this in](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=660) [the file Navigator the obsidian file](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=665) [Navigator so I'm now right clicking on](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=668) [the tab and I'm going to click here](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=671) [reveal in file navigation so when I do](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=674) [this then it takes me to the template](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=678) [file which is right here I'm going to](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=681) [make a copy of this file so I'm right](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=684) [clicking on this and I'm going to choose](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=686) [make a copy so I'm creating a second](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=689) [file because I'm going to be modifying](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=692) [this I don't want to change the original](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=694) [file so I click make a copy now when I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=697) [create a copy it opens in this xcolor](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=700) [draw View mode don't worry nothing's](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=704) [happened you can always click here right](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=706) [click on the tab and open as an X](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=710) [collateral drawing and then it will open](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=713) [as the next college for drawing I'm](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=715) [going to now right click here and I'm](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=717) [going to move my file to my](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=720) [tools](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=724) [slash templates so I have this is my](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=726) [templates folder for templator](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=729) [so by the way](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=733) [I should have said this earlier so here](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=735) [I'm using a community plugin called](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=738) [templator so this is the templator](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=740) [plugin you can install templator](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=743) [from Community plugins if you click here](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=747) [on browse and you type in](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=751) [templater then you can simply install it](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=753) [and you need to configure templator as](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=757) [well so here I'm going to scroll down in](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=761) [plug-in settings to templator and I'm](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=764) [going to just you see here this is my](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=767) [templates folder this is the tools slash](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=771) [templates so that's where my template or](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=774) [templates sit and so this is the I'm](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=778) [just going to rename this file so you](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=783) [can see that this is the copy this was](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=785) [the original and this is the copy that I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=787) [moved to the templator folder I'm going](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=790) [to again click here to reveal this file](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=793) [in file navigation and you can see here](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=797) [now I'm in my templates folder and this](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=799) [is my worldly map template and now I'm](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=804) [going to rename this just simply I'm](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=809) [going to rename this to awardly map](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=813) [like this and I'm going to save this](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=816) [and now if I want to create a new](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=820) [worldly map what I can do is I can open](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=822) [the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=826) [templator create new node from template](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=827) [action](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=832) [I have configured alt shift e as a](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=833) [hotkey but you don't need to I'm](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=837) [clicking on the create new node from](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=840) [template and I'm just going to type in](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=842) [Wordly map so I have my worldly map here](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=845) [this is the file in the templator folder](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=848) [I click on this and here an Untitled](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=851) [file was created and if I switch to](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=854) [excalator drawing then it's right here](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=859) [so this way you can have multiple](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=861) [templates not just a simple single](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=865) [template that we set up with excalator](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=867) [template but this way if you place](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=870) [multiple drawings or template drawings](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=872) [to your template or folder you can](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=875) [create all of them I'm going to delete](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=877) [this file by the way I could also just](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=880) [create a new empty node so now I created](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=883) [an empty node and I can again click](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=887) [control p templator and I can click open](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=891) [insert template model this is different](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=895) [you see this has the alt e shortcut so](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=898) [this applies the template to the file I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=901) [have opened so if I click this again I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=904) [can choose Wordly map and it's inserted](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=907) [and if I switch to excalator view mode](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=910) [then I have my template in this empty](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=913) [file I'm going to delete this as well so](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=917) [so far this is interesting but this is](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=920) [not yet](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=923) [the end there are two more things I want](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=924) [to show you which really takes the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=927) [templator templates to the next level so](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=930) [first of all let's just open so this is](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=933) [my template or template for worldly Maps](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=936) [let's add a timestamp on it so imagine](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=939) [that this is your template and you want](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=942) [to automatically create this template](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=944) [with a date stating the creation date so](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=946) [how would I do that what I would do is I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=950) [would add a text element here and I'm](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=953) [going to say created](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=956) [colon and now I'm going to insert a](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=959) [piece of code here and explain you what](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=962) [I'm doing so I'm going to add a simple](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=964) [templator script here so this symbol at](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=968) [the end and at the beginning marks a](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=971) [template or template code and this one](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=975) [right here is a simple JavaScript](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=977) [code to insert today's date so now my](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=982) [template is ready](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=986) [so let me now create a new file using](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=988) [this template so again I'm going to](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=991) [press Ctrl B and I'm going to type](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=993) [templator and I'm going to choose create](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=997) [a new node from template and I'm going](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1000) [to choose a worldly map](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1003) [now this file is created and I'm going](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1005) [to switch to open excalator drawing like](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1009) [this and you can see that here on top](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1013) [the template](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1017) [changed to](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1019) [the date today so the script was](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1021) [executed when I inserted this template](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1024) [so let me delete this file](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1028) [and let me just add one more trick so](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1031) [the additional trick I want to do](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1035) [first of all notice that here I'm using](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1037) [the apostrophe symbol and not the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1040) [quotation mark symbol so I could have](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1043) [also written the code like this but then](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1045) [it would not work](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1049) [I won't go into the details but the way](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1050) [the excalator Json is created in the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1053) [background this will then be converted](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1056) [to backslash quotation mark and the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1059) [script when templature tries to run the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1062) [script will fail so the point is you](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1065) [should use the apostrophe here and then](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1068) [your script lines will work fine so](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1072) [that's just as a side note but now the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1075) [bit that](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1079) [I don't like about this template is now](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1080) [if I create a new file here so I'm just](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1082) [going to create again an Untitled](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1085) [document so what I don't like about this](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1089) [is I'm going to insert my Wordly map](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1092) [that it opens like this and I still need](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1094) [to click](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1098) [open as X caller drop I mean this is not](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1099) [a huge issue but it would be nicer if it](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1102) [would automatically open as an](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1106) [excolletural file](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1108) [so the good news is this is possible and](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1110) [it's actually not that difficult so now](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1113) [I'm going to switch to the worldly map](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1116) [template in the templator folder](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1118) [and I'm going to switch to markdown View](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1121) [and here at the top above the text](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1125) [elements but below the front matter I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1128) [can add whatever I want to my template](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1132) [so in this case I'm going to add a short](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1135) [templator script](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1139) [so without going into too much detail](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1141) [what the script is going to do is it's](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1144) [going to execute a comment from the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1146) [command palette it's going to say if I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1149) [open control P I open the command](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1151) [palette there's a command palette action](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1153) [toggle X call it raw and toggle between](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1156) [excalator draw and markdown mode this is](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1161) [the action that needs to be toggled and](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1164) [it will just simply execute that four](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1168) [seconds after the file was created I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1170) [leave it four seconds so obsidian has](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1174) [time to process this file and for the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1176) [common palette action to be available so](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1180) [let's see how this works if I come here](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1183) [and I choose the insert templater model](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1186) [and I choose Wordly map and press enter](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1189) [Then after four seconds](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1192) [this turns over and becomes an ex](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1196) [collateral drawing](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1199) [so again this just automates the way](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1201) [this is created so if I would now create](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1204) [and I'm going to use now the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1207) [Ctrl P template there and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1211) [use the create new note from template](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1214) [again it's going to work the same way I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1217) [choose awardly map I press enter and I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1220) [just leave it for four seconds and after](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1223) [four seconds it automatically converts](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1226) [into an excalator drawing and this way](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1229) [you can see that this drawing has the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1232) [create date and it was automatically](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1235) [switched to the X collateral View](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1238) [so to recap adding the template to the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1244) [stencil Library I think is super easy](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1247) [and practical this would be my number](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1249) [one recommendation](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1252) [creating an exclature template is good](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1254) [if you want to use the template on all](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1257) [your files so for example adding a grid](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1260) [to that template could be something that](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1263) [is useful](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1266) [inserting the template is an image I](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1268) [think this is good if your template](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1270) [includes some pictures as well because](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1273) [those will not fit the stencil library](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1275) [but on the back of this we explored the](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1278) [benefit of having](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1282) [backlinks and finding all the instances](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1284) [of where I'm using the template but by](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1287) [the way then we had this conversation](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1290) [that if you add a hidden tag as a text](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1292) [element to your](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1296) [template that's in the stencil library](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1299) [then you can achieve something pretty](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1301) [similar using the tag Pane and obsidian](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1303) [search](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1306) [and finally we looked at the templator](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1307) [templates](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1310) [yes this is slightly more complicated](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1312) [but it comes with huge benefits because](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1315) [in this case you can add things like](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1318) [timestamps and you can add also custom](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1321) [tags and custom text elements and all](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1324) [sorts of good things through this you](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1327) [can also via the facilities provided by](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1330) [templater you can assign hotkeys to](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1334) [different X collateral templates we are](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1336) [now not going into those details in this](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1338) [video but actually doing this sort of](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1341) [templating with templator opens a whole](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1345) [new world for X collateral automation so](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1347) [I hope you found this video helpful and](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1352) [please let me know if you have other](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1355) [practical problems that you would like](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1357) [to see solutions for and I'm happy to](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1359) [create other videos that walk through](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1362) [specific use cases and explain how to](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1364) [automate that process using excalator](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1367) [and obsidian](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1370) [thank you](https://youtu.be/jgUpYznHP9A?t=1371)
