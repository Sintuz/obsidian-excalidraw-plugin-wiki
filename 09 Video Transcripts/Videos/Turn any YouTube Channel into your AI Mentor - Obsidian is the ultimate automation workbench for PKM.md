# Content
Hey everyone, it's Zsolt here. Happy New Year and welcome to Visual PKM. Today's video is inspired by this problem: even though I have over 250 videos about Obsidian, Excalidraw, and visual PKM on YouTube, and I have over 400 detailed release notes on GitHub about each of the plugin releases, when you have a specific question, it's extremely hard to find the answer. I'm thinking of questions like this one that I receive on Discord, Twitter, YouTube, and email—you name it, I get it all the time. Here’s a typical question: how can I turn on that panel with pens and other functions on the right side of the screen? Of course, the person is referring to this panel right here, and you need to know that you need to enable custom pens in plugin settings, and you need to long-click on scripts in the Obsidian tools panel to pin them here. Then you have the right-hand side panel, which is super handy; I use it a lot. But how can you find the answer to such questions? How can you find out of the 250 videos the one that talks about this? It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack. This is the problem that I'm going to give you a solution for today. [* ](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=0)

So the video is built up like this: first, we're going to talk about the solution to this problem exactly. But then, as I was developing my solution, I made it slightly more generic because what I was thinking is, of course, I'm going to have future releases and you will need to find help for that as well. So I need to update it, etc. I made it more generic, but as I did that, that's when it dawned on me that what I've built is so much more powerful. This is such a powerful PKM tool if you want to learn something or if you want to engage in a topic that’s on YouTube. The solution that I'm going to show you is going to blow your mind away. This is an amazing solution for an extremely broad range of use cases, and it's super easy to implement. Finally, all of this led me to something that I'm going to launch today. This has been on my mind for over a year now. This is something I'm extremely passionate about, and I think you and everyone who's in PKM and outside PKM should have this. Stick around and you'll find out what I'm launching. [* ](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=45)

To make this video playful, we're going to play with this puzzle and we already have the first two pieces. We’ve already talked about them: I have 250 YouTube videos and I have over 400 release notes. The next piece of the puzzle is Notebook LM, and recently I’ve released multiple videos on Notebook LM. First of all, there's a podcast from the future that shows you how you can create or turn your notes into a podcast. Then in the two AI workflows video, I talk about this workflow where you take a topic with multiple books and PDFs; you drop it into Notebook LM, create an overview podcast, and then mind map that podcast. This method serves as a thinking loop to structure your understanding of a topic that you are already familiar with. I also talk about this here, and I show you a mind map that I created this way. Finally, I used Notebook LM in "Should You Trust AI with Your Second Brain?" If you're not familiar with Notebook LM, it's this cool tool from Google that you can drop documents into, and you can ask it specific questions. Here's a use case: you can see I have lots of Notebook LM notebooks already. One use case I used it for recently was at work; we were trying to understand what the EU AI Act means for our company. So, I downloaded the PDF from the EU website, dropped it into Notebook LM, and created a short podcast to get a 10-minute overview about what this is about. Then I was able to ask Notebook LM specific questions about the AI Act, receiving targeted answers to my questions. [* ](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=90)

So my idea is, if I’m able to feed the 250 videos and the 400 release notes into Notebook LM, then bingo— I can build a tool that you can ask about videos and release notes. You can ask it about Obsidian Excalidraw. But there’s a catch here; actually, there are two catches. First, I need to get hold of the YouTube transcripts. So how can I get hold of the 250 transcripts that I have? The second, but even bigger issue is, Notebook LM only allows you to add 50 resources, and of course, 250 plus 400 is clearly greater than 50. So there is an issue of how I can somehow condense the 250 into 50 that I can then process with Notebook LM. This is where the fourth piece of the puzzle comes in: I created two scripts. I actually used ChatGPT to help me with this, and it was a pretty fast process to create the scripts. Both of them use Templater. This is the vault that I was using to process all of these notes, and I created these two scripts here. One is to fetch video data, and the other is to generate markdown notes. I'm using two plugins: Templater as the core plugin to run the script and AI for Templater. The way I processed each of the videos is using ChatGPT; I also created a summary, key takeaways, and formatted content. But then under it, I have the details from YouTube as well, so I have the YouTube description and I have the timestamped transcript. So here on the transcript, I can click wherever and it takes me there in the video, and you can see this for each of my videos. I also have this formatted transcript that links with the relevant timestamps. [* ](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=135)

The reason I did it like this was also because I'm publishing all of this on the Excalidraw Obsidian Wiki page, so there's a link to the Wiki in the video description. I'm adding a number of additional resources: my old blog posts and these videos, so all the 200+ videos are available with the full text, descriptions, timestamps, and the entire transcript—each of them with the relevant links. These are all, of course, linked. That's what I want to show you; this is a timestamped transcript, so this is all available there. But the point here that I want to highlight is that I created these two scripts, and the scripts also create an output that I call quarterly. I decided to bundle videos into files based on each quarter because, since my channel hasn't been going for that long—it's only been active since 2021—I only get a handful of files. Each of these files looks like this: each video has a title, and under it, you can find all the data that I just showed you. So here you can see that these were the videos that I published in this quarter, and then I took these files and fed them into Notebook LM. You can see all of these files plus some additional ones. Let’s see how this model would answer the question: how can I turn on that panel with pens and other functions on the right side of the screen? Let’s keep fingers crossed that we get something meaningful. [* ](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=201)

So the panel—there you go. The panel you’re referring to is called the custom tools panel, and it can be activated by toggling tray mode. That's actually not correct; go to menu, toggle tray mode, and then… No, tray mode didn’t do the trick for me. This panel has lots of buttons, including pens and scripts, and it is on the right side of the canvas. So let’s see—indeed, you do need to be persistent sometimes in asking, but sometimes it answers very well. It is not the tray mode. How can I turn on custom pens? Okay, so here we go. Go to Obsidian settings, non-Excal supported features, and custom pens. Now we are on the right track. What I want to show you here is if I click it, it takes me to the video. Once you enable… let’s see where this takes me. So this takes me… moving on, come to custom pens. This is good; this now talks about custom pens and how I turn them on. But let’s maybe take a look at another example of a question. Here’s a question I received two days ago: why can’t I give properties to my Excalidraw drawings? Which, of course, you can give properties to. That's a misunderstanding. Let’s see; you might be having a couple of misunderstandings. Are you referring to document properties, like found in YAML format, usually stored in YAML format? Visual properties? Yeah, and so I am thinking of YAML properties. How can I add them to Excalidraw? This looks pretty relevant, so it does talk about switching to markdown view mode, and it also talks about some of the Excalidraw-specific document properties, and it also takes you to this document properties file where you can see all of the different Excalidraw properties. Here’s a good response that explains where you can find that. [* ](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=289)

But there’s a sad face there. The next piece in our puzzle is that I created this Notebook LM, and I wanted to share it publicly so I can give you a link—you can log in and you can ask your questions. Unfortunately, Google doesn't allow that. But you can train your own model, so let me show you how it’s super easy. In the video description, I included a file. If you extract this, you’ll get a folder with the training files, and all you need to do is head over to notebooklm.google.com. If you don’t yet have an account, you need to create one. Click here to create new, and all you need to do here is take these files and drop them in. Indeed, it was less than a minute—we already have this here, and you can start asking questions from Notebook LM. [* ](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=393)

So let’s move on; what’s the next piece in the puzzle? This is where my mind blew away because I realized that what I built is so much more than just for visual PKM. I can download any YouTube channel, all the videos and all the transcripts, and I can actually create a Notebook LM and start to think about that topic. If there's a channel that you follow about a topic that you’re interested in, with the same script, you can download all the transcripts, create the documents, and generate the training data. Let me show you how this would work, and also I'm going to have a link, but you’ll need to wait a little more in the video to find out how you can get the demo vault. The vault that I'm going to share with you is going to be here in a zip file called the YouTube Downloader Vault. Once I'm ready with that, I'm just going to copy this and head over to my Obsidian folder, paste it in here, and now I’m going to head over to manage vaults. I’m going to open a new vault, and here I'm going to select the YouTube Downloader Vault. Then Obsidian starts and it’s going to ask you to trust and enable plugins. Once you’re in here, you need to do two settings: first of all, you need to go to AI for Templator and add your API keys. The welcome screen will explain to you how to get your OpenAI key and will lead you to the scripts folder to fetch video data; here you need to provide the Google Cloud API key as well. I'm going to paste it in here and here's a description of how you can get your own. Once you’ve set up your API keys, you will need to clean up the data. This will come with the preconfigured data from my own YouTube channel, but you can just as easily delete everything from the output folder. You can also delete the miscellaneous files. This can be deleted as well. So, I've deleted everything. By the way, just a half-sentence here: from a cost perspective, processing my 250 videos and I actually processed this multiple times because I was also testing the process cost me a total of fifty cents—forty-nine cents. So this is dirt cheap! Money is not a blocker here. [* ](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=459)

What I want to show you now is how to download a YouTube channel. I thought a good channel to play with is Nicole Vander Hoven's channel. So what you need to do is go to the channel homepage and copy the channel link. When you have the demo vault, you can press Alt + E or Option + E. That’s going to open the Templater modal, and here I need to click on fetch video data. I'm just going to replace this and add Nicole’s channel here, and it’s going to start to run. These are the videos that it's downloading! Each of these notes here is a separate video, and when it appears, that’s when it has downloaded the details, the transcript, and everything. This is going to take a couple of minutes; depending on the channel, it can be up to ten minutes or more. The download is ready, and once we are ready with this, then this file appeared here called data. You will see this message from Obsidian that it’s taking a long time because data is a super big file with all the downloaded material. You don’t need to worry about the data here; it's just to show you that everything that was downloaded is here. If you don’t delete data, then the next time you run the script, it will first read the existing data, and it won't download everything from YouTube again, just the missing pieces. You can download multiple channels into the same data folder, and they will live beautifully next to each other. Once we’re done with this, we can run the generate markdown script. So I'm going to press Alt + E again. You can choose different GPT models; I’m using GPT-4 mini because that’s the lowest cost, and for this purpose, it does a great job. All we need to do is a bit of clean-up because typically, transcripts are not very well formatted, so that’s what I’m using it for, and plus to create key takeaways and a summary. Now we’re going to download videos only from, let’s say, the first of June this year. I know Nicole over the past couple of months hasn’t created many videos, so this is not going to be too many videos; I think in August she stopped. Here you can see that we already have video files appearing! You can see that since June, she published five videos, and these are the videos that she published—this is the actual text of those videos. Right now, we are not going to dive deep into this, but this is what we downloaded, and here are the quarterly files as well for Q2 and Q3. From here, you can do exactly as I showed you earlier. If I open this in Explorer or Finder, then I can take the quarterly files and drop them into Notebook LM, and I can talk to Notebook LM about this channel. Again, you can combine multiple channels like this. If you're interested, you can run the script in the same vault multiple times. Then, you can take all of those and drop them into Notebook LM. One side comment: I don’t recommend doing this in your main vault, so I published these files to the Obsidian Excalidraw Wiki. But before that, I processed the files here, and when I was ready, then I copied them over to my main vault, which I use for publishing to Obsidian Publish. That’s what I recommend; keep this vault with the downloads separate. [* ](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=531)

This brings us to the next puzzle piece—first one is about Obsidian being a perfect workbench for such PKM projects. I cannot stress this enough! Obsidian with the API, with Templater, with Data View, with Excalidraw, and automation scripts, and of course with the support of models like ChatGPT that help you create scripts—Obsidian is the ideal platform for these projects. I'm finding that my go-to tool for such automation is exclusively Obsidian, and I use it for many things. This is one example, but really every week there’s a use case where I need to automate something or process some data. It could be for work, it could be for a hobby, or it could be for my channel—there are many cases. Just yesterday, I downloaded all my old blog posts from blogger.com that I wanted to commission, and they are now available in Obsidian Publish. And guess what? How did I do it? I did the whole process using Obsidian and some scripts. So, Obsidian is your operating system for PKM, and it’s so much more than just a note-taking tool. If you learn how to use these features in Obsidian, it becomes a magic toolbox of powerful tools that you can use for PKM processes like this one. If there's a YouTube channel you want to get the data from, you want to learn from it, or integrate some of these notes into your own notes, Obsidian gives you the tools that make this really super easy. It's handy, it's easy, it works, and it's integrated with all your other notes. That's just an important takeaway from all of this: Obsidian is the perfect tool for PKM tinkering or PKM automation. [* ](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=637)

This takes us to the last piece in our puzzle, and that's the launch of Technov Visual PKM. I'm launching the Technov Visual PKM Community—check the link in the video description. There’s going to be a launch event; it’s free, and you can sign up for free. It’s going to be next week Saturday, the 11th of January, in the evening European Time, which means it’ll be early morning in Australia and New Zealand and midday to afternoon in the US. Hopefully, everyone finds their right time. In Tokyo, it’s going to be 5:00 in the morning, so it's borderline acceptable. Unfortunately, with a global time zone, it's impossible to find the ideal time for everyone. Sign up for the kickoff session—the launch session. At the launch session, we're going to look at the workflow that I talked about today. There are so many special cases, so if you want to find out how many videos are in a data file, what the earliest and latest video is, or how many videos you have per quarter—these are all good questions that are easy to find if you know how to ask the script. The community is going to be a paid community, so after this free event, you will need to sign up if you continue to be interested. I plan this to be an interactive community where we talk about everything around PKM automation. It could be Excalidraw scripts, Data View, Templater, AI for Templater, or any other automation in and around Obsidian. The idea is you can bring your projects, and we can work on those together as a community, or you can come with questions. You will have like-minded people who share information and work on these projects together. I think this is an awesome community, and I really have high hopes for how this is going to work. This is not just for the blackmailed pros; my idea is to make this approachable where you can really learn the basics of scripting and learn how you can use ChatGPT and other tools to help you along the way. It’s actually not that difficult. Of course, you need to have some basic command of an understanding of scripting, but it is not that hard. So I encourage you to check out the launch session; you can find the link in the video description. When you sign up for the launch session, you will get a link to download this demo vault so you can already play with this downloader process, and we can then have a conversation around it. Hopefully, I’ll see you at the launch session. [* ](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=740)

Just to recap what we covered today, we started from this basic problem: how can I find relevant information about Obsidian Excalidraw? From here, we went to a more generic solution about how to download YouTube videos and how to process them into meaningful files. That led to the idea that this can be used for any YouTube channel. Finally, this takes us to Technov Visual PKM, because Obsidian is your ideal PKM automation workbench. If you learn the basics of how to use this workbench, then Obsidian opens up to you. It is so much more than just a note-taking tool. Already, Excalidraw transforms Obsidian into this beautiful visual tool, but if you add scripting skills, it transforms it into a creative tool that you can use to automate and use AI to really do whatever you have in mind in terms of your notes, interrogating data, and getting more out of your PKM. That’s all I had in store for you today. I hope you enjoyed it, and I hope to see you next week Saturday. Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=773)

questions how can you find out of](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=77) [the 250 videos the one that talks about](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=80) [this it's like looking for a needle in](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=83) [the Hast](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=86) [stack this is the problem that I'm going](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=87) [to to give you a solution for](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=89) [today so the video is built up like this](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=92) [first we're going to talk about the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=97) [solution to this problem exactly but](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=99) [then as I was developing my solution I](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=102) [made it slightly more generic because](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=106) [what I was thinking is of course I'm](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=108) [going to have future releases and you](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=110) [will need to find help for that as well](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=113) [so I need to update it Etc I made it](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=115) [more gen generic but as I did that](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=118) [that's when it dawned on me that what](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=122) [I've built is so much more powerful this](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=124) [is such a powerful PKM tool if you want](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=127) [to learn something if you want to engage](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=132) [in a topic that's on YouTube the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=135) [solution that I'm going to show you is](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=138) [going to blow your mind away this is an](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=140) [amazing solution for an extremely broad](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=143) [range of use cases and it's super easy](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=147) [to implement and then finally all of](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=150) [this led me to something that I'm going](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=154) [to launch today this has been on my mind](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=156) [for over a year now this is something](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=159) [I'm extremely passionate about and I](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=163) [think you and everyone who's in PKM and](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=165) [outside PKM should have](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=169) [this stick around and you'll find out](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=173) [what I'm launching so to make this video](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=176) [playful we're going to play with this](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=179) [puzzle and we already have the first two](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=181) [pieces we already talked about them so I](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=184) [have 250 YouTube videos and I have over](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=187) [400 release notes the next piece of the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=191) [puzzle is notebook LM and recently I've](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=195) [released multiple videos on Notebook](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=199) [LM first of all podcast from the future](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=203) [that shows you how you can create or](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=207) [turn your notes into a podcast then in](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=210) [the two AI workflows video I talk about](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=214) [this workflow where you take a topic](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=217) [with multiple books and PDFs you drop it](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=220) [into notebook LM you create a an](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=223) [overview podcast you then mind map that](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=226) [podcast and use this as a thinking Loop](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=229) [to structure your understanding of a](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=233) [topic that you already otherwise know](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=236) [and are familiar of it and so I talk](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=238) [about this here and I show you a mind](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=241) [map that I created this way and finally](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=244) [I use notebook LM in uh should you trust](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=247) [AI with your second brain and just if](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=251) [you're not familiar with notebook LM](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=254) [notebook LM is this cool tool from](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=256) [Google that you can drop documents into](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=259) [and you can as them here's a use case](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=262) [you can see I have lots of notebook LM](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=265) [notebooks already one use case I used it](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=268) [for recently was at work we were trying](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=272) [to understand what the eui ACT means for](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=277) [our company so I downloaded the PDF from](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=281) [the EU website I dropped it into](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=286) [notebook LM I created a short podcast to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=288) [get a 10minute overview about what this](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=292) [is about and then I was able to ask the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=295) [document notebook LM specific questions](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=300) [about the AI act with targeted answers](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=304) [to my questions so my idea is that if](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=308) [I'm able to feed the 250 videos and the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=312) [400 release notes into notebook LM then](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=316) [bingo I can build a tool that you can](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=320) [ask about videos and release notes you](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=323) [can ask it about obsidian XC](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=327) [draw](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=330) [but there's a catch here actually there](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=331) [are two catches here catch number one is](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=334) [I need to get hold of the YouTube](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=338) [transcripts so how can I get hold of the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=341) [250](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=344) [transcripts that I](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=346) [have and then the second but is an even](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=348) [bigger issue notebook LM only allows you](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=352) [to add 505 Z resources and of course](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=356) [250+ 400 is clearly greater than 50 so](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=360) [there is an issue of how can I somehow](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=366) [condense the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=369) [250 into 50 that I can then process with](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=371) [notebook LM so this is where the fourth](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=376) [piece of the puzzle comes here so I](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=380) [created two scripts I actually used Chad](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=383) [GPT to help me with this and it was](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=386) [pretty fast process to create the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=389) [scripts both of them use templat so this](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=391) [is the Vault that I was using to process](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=395) [all of these notes and I created these](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=398) [two scripts here one is to fetch video](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=401) [data the other is to generate markdown](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=405) [notes and here I'm using two plugins I'm](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=408) [using templator as the core plugin to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=412) [run the script and I'm using AI for temp](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=415) [because the way I processed each of the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=420) [video and let me just show you an](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=423) [example output so here's a video that I](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=426) [processed I processed it like this that](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=430) [using CH GPT I also created a summary](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=434) [key takeaways and a formatted content](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=438) [but then under it I have the details](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=442) [from YouTube as well so I have the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=445) [YouTube description and I have the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=447) [timestamped transcript so here on the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=450) [transcript I can click wherever and it](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=454) [takes me there in the video and so you](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=456) [can see this for each of my videos I](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=459) [have this here and also the formatted](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=462) [transcript as well has this link with](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=466) [the relevant Tim stamp so you can see](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=469) [there the YouTube Tim stamps so each of](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=471) [the paragraphs at the end of the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=474) [paragraph if you read this paragraph and](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=476) [it's interesting you can click on the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=479) [Tim stamp and it takes you to the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=481) [location in the video the reason I did](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=484) [this like this was also because I'm](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=487) [publishing all of this on the excal](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=491) [obsidian Vicki page so there's a link to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=494) [the Vicki in the video description I'm](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=497) [adding a number of additional resources](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=500) [my old blog posts these videos so all](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=503) [the 200 plus videos are available with](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=507) [the full text and with the descriptions](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=511) [with the timestamps and with the entire](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=514) [transcript each of them with the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=517) [relevant links so these are all of](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=520) [course links that's what I want to show](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=522) [you that this is here a timestamped uh](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=524) [transcript so this is all available](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=527) [there but the point here that I want to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=530) [highlight is I created these two scripts](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=534) [and the scripts Al also create me an](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=537) [output that I call quarterly so I](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=541) [decided to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=546) [bundle videos into files based on each](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=548) [quarter because then uh that is clearly](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=553) [since my channel has is not that long](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=556) [it's only been going since 2021 I I only](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=558) [get a handful of files and of course](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=562) [each of these files look like this that](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=565) [each video has a title and then under](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=569) [the video you can find all the data that](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=572) [I just showed you so here you can see](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=575) [that these were the videos that I](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=578) [published in this quarter and then I](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=580) [took these files and I fed them into](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=583) [notebook LM you can see here all of](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=586) [these files plus some additionals so](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=588) [let's see how this model would answer](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=591) [the question how can I turn that panel](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=594) [with pens and other functions on the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=596) [right side of the screen and let's keep](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=598) [fingers crossed that we get something](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=601) [meaningful so the panel there you go so](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=604) [the panel you're referring to is called](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=608) [the custom tools panel and it can be](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=610) [activated by toggling tray mode that's](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=614) [actually not correct go to menu toggle](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=616) [tray mode and and then no tray mode](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=620) [didn't do the trick for for me this](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=626) [panel has lots of buttons including pens](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=631) [and scripts and it is on the right side](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=637) [of the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=643) [canvas so let's see indeed you do need](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=645) [to be persistent sometimes in asking but](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=648) [sometimes it answers very well um it is](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=652) [not the tray mode how can I turn on](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=656) [custom pens okay so here go to obsidian](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=661) [settings non excal supported features](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=665) [and custom pens this is now we are on](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=668) [the right track what I want to show you](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=671) [here is if I click two it takes me to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=673) [the place in the once you enable let's](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=676) [see where this takes me so this takes me](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=680) [moving on come to custom pens this is](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=683) [good so this now talks about in a video](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=686) [Let's see which video this is so I want](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=690) [to proceed this is actually a good video](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=693) [so here I talk about the custom pens and](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=696) [how I turn it on but let's maybe take a](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=699) [look at another example of a question so](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=702) [here's a question that I received two](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=705) [days ago why can't I give properties to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=707) [my excolo drawings which of course you](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=710) [can give properties so that's a](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=713) [misunderstanding let's see you're trying](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=716) [to you might have a couple of](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=718) [misunderstandings when you mentions are](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=720) [you referring to document properties](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=722) [like found in yl and document usually](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=725) [stored in yl format visual properties](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=728) [yeah and so I am thinking of yaml](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=732) [properties how can I add them to excort](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=738) [lid raw this looks pretty relevant so it](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=743) [does talk about switching to markdown](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=747) [View mode and it also talks about some](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=750) [of the EXC colid draw specific document](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=753) [properties and it also takes you to this](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=757) [document properties file where you can](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=761) [see all of the different excital](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=764) [properties but also a good response here](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=766) [that explains to you where you can find](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=771) [that but there's a sad face there so the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=774) [next piece in our puzzle](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=779) [is I created this notebook LM and I](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=782) [wanted to share it publicly so I can](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=785) [give you a link you can log in and you](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=788) [can ask your questions unfortunately](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=790) [Google doesn't allow that but you can](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=793) [train your own model so let me show you](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=797) [how it's super easy in the video](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=799) [description I included a file and if you](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=803) [extract this then you will get a folder](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=807) [with the training files and all you need](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=811) [to do is you need to head over to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=814) [notebook lm. goole.com if you don't yet](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=817) [have an account you need to create an](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=821) [account you need to click here create](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=823) [new and all you need to do here is to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=826) [take these files and drop them in here](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=829) [and indeed it was less than a minute we](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=834) [already have this here and you can start](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=836) [asking questions from notebook](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=840) [LM so let's move on what's the next](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=842) [piece in the puzzle and this is where my](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=846) [mind blew away because I realized that](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=849) [what I built is so much more than just](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=854) [for visual](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=859) [PKM I can download any YouTube site all](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=861) [the videos and all the transcripts](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=866) [and I can actually create a notebook LM](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=869) [and start to think about that topic so](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=872) [if there's a there's a channel that you](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=874) [follow that's about the topic

you can create the documents](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=885) [and you can create the training data let](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=888) [me show you how this would work and also](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=890) [I'm going to have a link but you'll need](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=893) [to wait a little more in the video to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=895) [find out how you can get the demo Vault](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=897) [uh the Vault that I'm going to share](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=900) [with you is going to be here in a zip](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=902) [file it's called the YouTube downloader](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=905) [Vault and once I'm ready with that then](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=908) [I'm just going to copy this and I'm](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=912) [going to head over to my obsidian folder](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=915) [just going to paste it in here and now](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=918) [I'm going to head over to here manage ws](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=922) [and I'm going to open a new Vault and](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=926) [here I'm going to select the YouTube](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=930) [downloader Vault then obsidian starts](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=933) [it's going to ask you to trust and](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=936) [enable plugins once you're in here you](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=938) [need to do two settings first of all you](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=941)

data and here you need to provide](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=961) [the Google Cloud API key as well I'm](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=965) [going to paste it in here and here's a](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=969) [description of how you can get your own](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=971) [and once you've set up your API Keys you](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=974) [will need to clean up the data so this](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=978) [will come with the preconfigured data of](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=981) [my own YouTube channel but you can just](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=985) [simply](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=988) [uh Delete all of these everything from](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=989) [the output folder you can just simply](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=992) [delete and also you don't need the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=995) [miscellaneous uh files so this can be](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=999) [deleted as well so I've deleted](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1002) [everything by the way just a half](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1005) [sentence here that from a cost](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1007) [perspective processing my 250 videos and](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1010) [actually I processed this multiple times](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1014) [because I was also testing the process](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1017) [cost me a total of 50 cents 49 cents so](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1020) [this is dirt cheapap this is this is](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1024) [definitely money is not a blocker here](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1027) [and what I want to show you now is let's](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1031) [download a YouTube channel and I thought](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1034) [a good channel to play with is Nicole](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1038) [Vander hovind's channel so what you need](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1041) [to do is you need to go to the channel](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1043) [homepage and you need to copy the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1046) [channel link and then when you have the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1049) [demo Vol you can press alt e or option e](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1052) [that's going to open the open templator](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1057) [model and here I need to click on fetch](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1061) [video data and I'm just going to replace](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1065) [this and add Nicole's channel here and](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1069) [it's going to start to run these are the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1074) [videos that it's downloading so each of](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1076) [these notes Here is a separate video and](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1079) [when it appears that's when it has](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1083) [downloaded the details the transcript](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1086) [and everything this is going to take](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1089) [couple of minutes depending on the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1091) [channel this can be up to 10 minutes or](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1094) [more the download is ready and once we](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1098) [are ready with this then the this file](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1101) [appeared here called data and you're](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1106) [going to this message from obsidian that](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1108) [it's taking a long time because data is](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1110) [a super big file with all of the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1114) [downloaded material you don't need to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1117) [worry about the data here it's just to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1119) [show you that everything that was](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1122) [downloaded is](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1124) [here if you don't delete data then the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1125) [next time you run the script it will](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1129) [first read the existing data and it](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1132) [won't download everything from YouTube](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1135) [again but only the missing pieces that's](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1137) [why the data is stored here and by the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1140) [way you can download multiple channels](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1143) [into the same data they are going to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1146) [live beautifully next to each other but](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1149) [once we're done with this we can run the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1152) [generate markdown script so I'm going to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1155) [press alt e you can choose different GPT](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1158) [models I'm using GPT 40 mini because](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1162) [that's the lowest cost and for this](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1165) [purpose it does a great job all we need](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1168) [to do is just a bit of clean up because](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1171) [typically transcripts are not very well](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1174) [formatted so that's what I'm using it](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1177) [for and plus to create key takeaways and](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1180) [a summary and now we're going to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1184) [download videos only for let's say from](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1186) [1st of June this year I know Nicole over](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1191) [the past couple of month hasn't created](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1194) [videos so this is not going to be too](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1197) [many videos I think in August she](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1199) [stopped but here you can see that we](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1202) [already have video files appearing so](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1205) [you can see here each of the files that](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1209) [are appearing you can see that since](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1211) [June she published five videos and these](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1214) [are the videos that she published this](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1218) [is the actual text of those videos I](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1220) [mean right now we are not going to dive](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1224) [deep into this but this is what we](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1227) [downloaded and here are the quarterly](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1229) [files as well for Q2 and Q3 and from](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1231) [here you can do exactly the same as what](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1235) [I showed you earlier if I open this in](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1239) [Explorer or in finder then I can take](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1242) [the quarterly files and drop them into](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1246) [notebook LM and I can talk to notebook](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1249) [LM about this Channel and again you can](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1253) [combine multiple channels like this so](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1256) [if you're interested you can run the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1259) [script even in the same Vault multiple](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1261) [times and then you can take all of those](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1265) [and drop them into notebook LM now one](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1268) [side comment I don't recommend doing](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1272) [this in your main Vault so what I did](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1275) [was I published these files to the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1278) [obsidian xol of Vicki but before that I](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1280) [actually processed the files here and](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1284) [when I was ready then I copied them over](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1287) [to my main Vault that I use for](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1289) [publishing uh to obsidian publish and](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1292) [that's what I recommend that you keep](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1295) [this Vault with the downloads separate](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1298) [and this takes us to the next puzzle](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1302) [piece or next two puzzle pieces in our](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1304) [Puzzle first one is about obsidian being](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1308) [a perfect workbench for such PKM](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1312) [projects and I cannot stress has this](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1316) [enough obsidian with the API with](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1319) [templator with data view with excal](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1323) [automate scripts and of course with the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1325) [support of models like CH](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1329) [GPT that help you create script obsidian](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1333) [is the ideal platform to do such](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1337) [projects I'm finding](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1341) [that my go-to tool for such automation](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1344) [is exclusively obsidian and I use it for](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1349) [many things this is one example but](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1353) [really every week There's a use case](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1356) [where I need to automate something or](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1359) [process some data it could be for work](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1361) [it could be for hobby it could be for my](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1364) [channel it could there are many cases](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1367) [just yesterday I downloaded all my old](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1371) [blog posts from blogger.com that I](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1374) [wanted to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1377) [the commission anyway and they are now](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1379) [available in obsidian publish and guess](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1381) [what how did I do it I did the whole](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1384) [process using obsidian and some scripts](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1387) [so obsidian is your operating system for](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1390) [PKM and it's so much more than just a](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1396) [notetaking tool if you learn how to use](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1398) [these features in obsidian it becomes](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1402) [this magic toolbox of powerful tools](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1406) [that you can use for PKM processes like](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1411) [this one that there's a YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1414) [you want to get the data you want to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1416) [learn from it maybe you want to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1419) [integrate some of these notes into your](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1421) [own](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1423) [notes obsidian gives you the tools that](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1425) [this is really super easy it's handy](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1428) [it's easy it works and it's integrated](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1431) [with all your other notes so that's](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1435) [that's just for me an important takeaway](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1438) [from all of this that obsidian is the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1440) [perfect tool for bkm tinkering or PKM](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1444) [Automation and then this takes us to the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1449)

to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1475) [be evening European Time which means](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1479) [it's going to be relatively early](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1482) [morning

acceptable but unfortunately](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1499) [with a global time zone it's impossible](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1503) [to find the ideal time zone for

[we're going to look at this workflow](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1515) [that I talked about today there are so](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1518) [many special cases so for example you](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1521) [have the data Json or the data file](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1525) [there](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1528) [if you would want to find out how many](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1528) [videos it contains or what's the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1531) [earliest and the latest video or how](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1534) [many videos you have per quarter these](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1536) [are all good questions that are easy to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1539) [find if you know how to ask the script](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1543) [the community is going to be a paid](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1546) [community so after this free event you](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1549) [will need to sign up for the community](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1553) [if you continue to be interested it's](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1555) [it's I plan this to be an interactive](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1558) [Community where we talk about everything](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1562) [around PKM automation it can be excal](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1565) [draw scripts it can be data view it can](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1569) [be templator it can be AI for templator](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1571) [it can be any other Automation in and](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1574) [around obsidian the idea is you can](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1579) [bring your projects and we can work on](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1582) [that project together as a Community or](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1586) [you can come with questions you will](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1589) [have like-minded people who share](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1591) [information between each other and who](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1594) [work on these](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1597) [projects I think this is a an awesome](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1599) [Community I really have high hopes for](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1604) [how this is going to work and this is](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1608) [not for the blackmailed Pros my idea is](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1611) [to make this into something that's](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1615) [approachable where you can really learn](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1617) [the basics of scripting and learn how](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1621) [you can use CH GPT and other tools to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1624) [help you along the way it's actually not](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1628) [that difficult of course you need to](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1631) [have some basic command of the of of an](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1633) [understanding of scripting but it is not](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1638) [that hard so I encourage you to check](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1641) [out the launch session you can find the](https://youtu.be/l0cfhGwaAG8?t=1645)
