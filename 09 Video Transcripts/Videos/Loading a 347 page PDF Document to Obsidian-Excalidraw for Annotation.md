First, we need to open Obsidian and create a new note where we can import our PDF file.

Importing the PDF directly into Excalidraw might seem tricky, but it's straightforward with the right menu options. [* ](https://youtu.be/4FahIlgVPYQ?t=45)

After bringing your PDF into Excalidraw, you‚Äôll want to adjust its size and orientation to ensure it's easy to read. Zooming in on specific sections of the PDF can be extremely helpful when annotating, as it allows you to focus on key details without losing context. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the interface, as interaction with the tools can greatly enhance your annotation process. [* ](https://youtu.be/4FahIlgVPYQ?t=90)

Once you have your PDF loaded and properly positioned, the annotation tools available in Excalidraw will allow you to highlight, draw, and make notes directly on the document. Using colors and different styles can help organize your thoughts, making it easier to review later. Don't forget to save your annotations regularly to avoid losing any progress!

By following these steps, you can turn a large PDF into a dynamic and interactive resource for your studies. Whether you're using this method for research, project development, or personal learning, utilizing Visual PKM tools within Obsidian-Excalidraw can significantly elevate your workflow.
