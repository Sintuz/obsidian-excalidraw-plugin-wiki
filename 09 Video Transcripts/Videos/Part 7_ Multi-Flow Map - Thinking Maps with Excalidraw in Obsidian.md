![Part 7: Multi-Flow Map - Thinking Maps with Excalidraw in Obsidian](https://youtu.be/U9RZsSULrJM)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt introduces the concept of the multi-flow map, a thinking map designed to help users identify the causes and effects of significant events. He provides illustrative examples, such as reflecting on personal driving experiences and evaluating the success of a party, to demonstrate the practical applications of the multi-flow map. The video concludes with a teaser for the next installment in the series, focusing on the bridge map.

# Key Takeaways
- Multi-flow maps are useful tools for understanding the causes and effects of events, aiding in both reflection and prediction.
- Specific examples help illustrate how to successfully use multi-flow maps in various scenarios, from analyzing mistakes to celebrating successes.
- The series on thinking maps will continue with a focus on the bridge map in the next video.

Use the multi-flow map to understand the causes and effects of an event or to predict possible outcomes of a situation. Imagine, for example, that you dozed off for a second while driving and wanted to understand why this happened and what could have been the consequences. There are a number of reasons that may have led to the event, such as driving at a late hour, not having rested before the trip, feeling tired but not stopping for a rest, running out of coffee, and having passengers who have also fallen asleep. [* ](https://youtu.be/U9RZsSULrJM?t=9)

Looking at the consequences, you have drifted from your lane, which scared you enough to decide to stop for a rest at the next immediate opportunity. Also, you made a personal commitment never to travel at a late hour again. Multi-flow maps can be connected to one another. You can, for example, explore the potential consequences of drifting from your lane because you want to learn from the incident and will explore more deeply what has led to dozing off while driving.

Here, I'm reconstructing the flow map leading to the central event. Without completing this exercise, you may never realize that your procrastination, which led to the last-minute rush to get your assignment completed, was also one of the root causes of your near-miss accident. [* ](https://youtu.be/U9RZsSULrJM?t=68)

Let's look at another happier example. Imagine that you threw a party and it was an outstanding success. You'd want to know what you did right so you can repeat it in the future. You may also want to make a mental note of all the positive results as well. Finally, let's explore how you might use a multi-flow map to understand why you did not get the price you wanted for your used car. From the causes, it would seem that you did not do a good job at negotiating. The consequences are that you'll need to take a higher loan, you'll feel bad for a couple of days, and hopefully, you'll also learn from the event. [* ](https://youtu.be/U9RZsSULrJM?t=107)

The multi-flow map will help you understand causes and effects, looking back at past events or predicting the outcomes of future ones. This concludes the introduction of the multi-flow map. In the final video, I will cover the bridge map. Don't forget to subscribe so you're notified when part 8 is released. Thank you for watching. [* ](https://youtu.be/U9RZsSULrJM?t=167)
