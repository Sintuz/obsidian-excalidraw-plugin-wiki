![Launching Obsidian-Excalidraw image elements](https://youtu.be/_c_0zpBJ4Xc)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt introduces the latest features of the Obsidian-Excalidraw integration, including the ability to add image elements to drawings. He demonstrates how to insert images using various methods and how to manage embedded drawings and file histories. The pre-release version aims to enhance user experience while ensuring better performance and stability in the future.

# Key Takeaways
- You can add images to Obsidian-Excalidraw by selecting them through a button, dragging from the file explorer, or copying from the clipboard.
- Images and drawings can be managed within Obsidian, providing easy access and the ability to rename files as needed.
- The integration allows for embedded drawings and includes features for improved performance and better handling of large files.

Hey, I'm excited to announce that image elements have arrived to Obsidian Excalidraw as well! I just released the pre-release; I'll put the link in the description below. You can install it from there. After another day of testing, I'm going to release this to community plugins as well. So I just quickly want to show you how this works. So first of all, how do you add images to your drawing? There's a button up here; if you click the button, you can select an image. You double-click, click where you want the image, and that's it! You can resize the image, and if you hold shift, then you can also distort the image if you want. [* ](https://youtu.be/_c_0zpBJ4Xc?t=0)

Second, you can control drag and drop from the Obsidian file explorer. So let's take this file, I drag it here, I press the control button, and there you go—I’ve inserted this drawing into here. And then finally, I can copy-paste anything from the clipboard. So I come here, I copy this image, I come back, I press Ctrl + V, and the image appears in my drawing. The images are stored in Obsidian, so if I control-click on an image, then the image inside Obsidian will come up, and I can actually come here and rename this to "monkey" like this. And if I come back here, of course, the image is still here, but this is now called "monkey." I can also show you that here under attachments, I have my monkey PNG file that was pasted. [* ](https://youtu.be/_c_0zpBJ4Xc?t=61)

Secondly, what I want to show you is that you can embed Excalidraw drawings as well. That is my logo as the next Excalidraw drawing, and you can edit these drawings. So again, if I control-click my drawing, it opens up the drawing. Let's just do two quick changes here. I'm going to set this to transparent, and I'm going to maybe color this note here to be red like that. And now, if I come back to my drawing, then you can see that the image is now transparent and this node is now red. [* ](https://youtu.be/_c_0zpBJ4Xc?t=114)

Finally, I want to show you that in the markdown file. So if I click here to open this markdown note, there's a message here that if the image file is big, then the loading of this can take a while. But I want to show you the two changes. So change number one is embedded files appeared, and this is where all of the files that were embedded can be found. These are the links that I'm using in the plugin. Secondly, if I collapse the drawing, you can see I have an SVG snapshot, and I included this snapshot. These are the images; that's why it's quite big, because I have lots of images here. But then at the bottom you will see I also have the standard SVG text as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/_c_0zpBJ4Xc?t=160)

I included this for two reasons: one for simply longevity, so even if Excalidraw doesn't work in the future, for sure SVG support will be there, and this way all of your files always contain the latest snapshot of the drawing in an SVG format. Also, what I've done is I've taken the hover preview and I've converted it to use these snapshots, and that is good because then the loading is much faster—so that was also a performance thing. [* ](https://youtu.be/_c_0zpBJ4Xc?t=212)

And that's about it! Some of the features may have some rough edges still; I'm working on stabilizing everything in the solution. But I believe that this is now stable enough for broader consumption, so that's why I'm releasing it as a pre-release, and hopefully by the end of tomorrow, we'll come to a final stable version that I’m going to be publishing to community plugins. So hope you will find this useful, and hope you find it as exciting as I do. Thank you! [* ](https://youtu.be/_c_0zpBJ4Xc?t=264)
