![Mastering Concept Visualizations: A Simple Workflow for Creating Effective Visuals](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt discusses the concept of visualizations and provides a workflow for creating effective visuals, emphasizing that concept visualizations are not fine art but tools to represent abstract ideas. He shares methods for generating visuals, including thinking through messages, searching for images, and leveraging existing icon libraries. The video concludes with a practical exercise encouraging viewers to create their own visualizations for an effective reading concept.

# Key Takeaways
- Concept visualizations are representations of abstract ideas utilizing both images and text to convey complex messages.
- A structured seven-step workflow is provided for creating visuals, which includes defining the message, generating keywords, and considering the type of illustration needed.
- Leveraging existing icon libraries and engaging in practice and feedback loops are crucial for enhancing creativity in visual thinking.

Hey everyone, Jolt here. Today I'm going to talk about concept visualizations: what they are, what they are used for, and most importantly, what my workflow is for creating simple concept visuals. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

I'm not good at drawing; I can draw a stick figure, maybe a simple scene, especially if I can copy it from somewhere, but that's where it stops. At the same time, I am a visual thinker; I like to think in pictures, I like to think in diagrams, I like when things are visual. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

So over the years, I've perfected a workflow for myself to bridge the gap from not being very good at drawing to being able to create simple visuals and visual diagrams representing my ideas. I want to walk you through some of the basics of my thinking about this process. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

Concept visualizations are not fine art and not data visualizations; these have their domain of their own, and I'm not going to be talking about these today. Concept visualizations are functional visualizations of an abstract concept or idea, and they typically consist of an image and some text. If you just have text, then it's not really a visualization; if you only have an image, then it will be difficult to convey a complex idea. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

As an example, here's a page from the book "From the Crown" by Subing. In this book, Subing uses only emojis to tell a story. If you look at this page, then after a couple of minutes, it's actually possible to decipher what the story is about. Without a doubt, this has the benefit of being international; it is not language-specific, so you can read this regardless of your mother tongue. But you can also understand or imagine that conveying complex ideas using this setup is pretty hard. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

So let's look at a couple of examples. One set of examples could be called simple visual metaphors. In this case, a metaphor can be for a noun, for example, a typewriter for the word "author," or a rocket for the verb "launch." Or it could be this guy out of the box for the adjective of being "creative." [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

Another set of examples is that these visualizations can also be more abstract, like a visualization for a process or instructions or flows. In this case, the example I brought here is my PKM Veal, and you can see the steps in my PKM system and how they come together. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

Finally, in this introduction part, let's look at what concept visualizations can be used for. You can use them for presentations, you can use them for storytelling, you can use these visualizations in marketing, and you can use them to explain concepts—probably lots of others. Why would you use them? Because these make your message less boring; it is easier to remember when you can tie a topic to a visual. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

Finally, it is easier to understand. If you choose the right visualizations, then your message will be more easily conveyed to your audience. Now that we know what concept visualizations are and what they're used for, let's look at how they are created using a simple workflow. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

This is the workflow I'm following. This workflow has seven steps, and we're going to walk through these seven steps. But before we do that, let's look at some of the things that you should not do. Don't wait for the muse; even the biggest artists start to work, and as they work, the idea emerges. There are very few people, if any, who just sit down, have this spark of an idea, and come up with the most perfect visual to explain an idea. It doesn't work like that; it's not magic; it is a process, and sometimes it's hard work, so make sure you get to work instead of sitting around waiting for the muse or blaming that the muse never came; there is no such thing as a muse in this case. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

Also, don't jump right into searching for stock images. Very often, instead of thinking, we have an idea we want to represent, we jump in and start to search the web, search PowerPoint icons, whatever, to find something that we can stick on that slide so we can convey our message. Don't do that, because these typically lead to trivial ideas, and in the end, you will miss the mark on conveying the intended message. Most often, the message you want to convey is more nuanced than just a stock image would do, or maybe a stock image can do, but you need to find the right stock image. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

Don't just jump into searching right away; instead, start by thinking about the message you want to convey. Think through what it is that you want to tell with the picture. What do you want the receiver of the information to think or feel after they've seen your visual and heard your explanation? [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

Once you have this message in your mind, then think of keywords that you could use for searching for images or illustrations. Think of synonyms and antonyms for that keyword because these can also be very helpful in finding the right visualization. This is a place where I use ChatGPT very often; ChatGPT is fantastic in coming up with synonyms, antonyms, as well as if you explain your message, it can come up with keywords to support your search when you're looking for icons and images. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

If you want to be more creative, you can also ask ChatGPT to recommend poems or fine art that conveys the message you want to share and work from the pictures or images in these creations. You can also think of or ask ChatGPT to help you with homonyms, homophones, and homographs because these may trigger visual puns and may put the whole idea into a completely different light, which will help you find the right visualizations for the idea you want to convey. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

Once you have your keywords, think about the type of illustration that you need. It could be image and text, as I explained earlier; it may be that in the end, it's a text-only message that you want to convey, so it's okay to have text, and it's also okay to have text only if that's the best solution. But it could also be a diagram or a scene that you can compose using several different icons that will convey a situation or a scene. In some cases, if the message is simple, or if you're doing user interface design, then just a single image and icon is perfectly sufficient. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

Once you know the type of image you want, the message you want, and the keywords you want, this is the time when you can start searching or when you should start searching—looking on the internet, looking for inspiration. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

These are the typical places that I look. I have a FlatIcon subscription, and this is my number one go-to place. Most of the images that you see in this presentation as well come from FlatIcon. Some of the visualizations also in this presentation I created with MyJourney, and I have a dedicated video that I'm going to include in the video description that shows you how you can use MyJourney to generate custom SVG icons. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

Of course, there's always Google and Google Image Search; that's excellent for finding images, as well as The Noun Project. I'm going to include the link in the video description; The Noun Project is a fantastic place if you're looking for icons and looking for creative ideas. I think these are the basic go-to places. Apart from these, you might want to check various stock photo places, and stock photos might also be a good way to get inspiration or simply use the photo as your illustration. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

But before using an icon or an image from the internet, I recommend first building from your existing icons and images. This is especially important if you work in a system like Obsidian, where you can use these images to connect ideas. It's probably less important if you're creating PowerPoint presentations that are anyway disconnected, but if you do this in Obsidian, then using the images will increase the connectivity of the thoughts in your world. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

So let me show you what I mean. I have an image library, and I have a dedicated video; you'll find it as well in the video description, on how to create this image library. This is an icon library that searches my entire Obsidian vault and pulls out all the icons that I have in my vault based on a naming convention. If I want to reuse an icon from here, I can right-click, click copy, and I can paste it into my drawing. By pasting the icon from here, it will not paste the image but will paste the reference to the image. This way, I can reuse the existing resource and connect to the existing resource. If you do this, then with Excalibrain, you will be able to see the connections between your thoughts using the icons. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

In this example, what you can see here is the Excalibrain screen for the concept visualizations summary presentation. The concept map that we're looking at right now is in the center. Above the slide, you have the sources—the parent nodes—and below it, you have the child nodes. In this case, you can see that there are lots of attachments as child nodes; these are the different images on the concept map. If you look close enough, then you will see that each of these icons has a small number here at the top, and also in some cases, they have a small number on the bottom. In this case, I don't see it, but here you can see that the central node has the small 37 and the 4. What does it mean? It means it has four parents and has 37 children. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

If I look at the children, then I can see that, for example, the paper airplane has nine parents. This is an interesting example to explore, so let's jump in and take a look at what this paper airplane does. I need to click here on the paper airplane, and when I click on the paper airplane, then in the background, the image of the paper airplane opens. Here in Excalibrain, I can see the paper airplane in the center, and I can see the different documents where I've used this paper airplane. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

We can take a quick look at where I've used the paper airplane. For example, I've used the paper airplane in my book on a page summary for building a second brain, and here it is used in a metaphor where Thiago says that the reason I'm creating a mini summary of the book is because I'm packaging my learnings from the book and I'm sending it to my future self. So this is what this represents right here. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

But I'm also using the same paper airplane in "How to Take Smart Notes" in the virtual cycle, and you can see here that again the paper airplane appears. I also use the paper airplane in "Digesting What You Read," so this was a recent video I published, and you can see that at the end of the process, at step 8, I'm using the paper airplane to represent the activity of publishing, and so on. You get the idea that by reusing the image, I'm able to connect ideas within my Obsidian vault. This is why I recommend that before going and looking for a brand-new icon, look at your icon library and think about which one you could repurpose. How could I modify what I already have by adding another icon next to it or maybe just adding a line on top or something like that to make it usable for my specific purpose to convey my message? [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

So getting back to our story—back to concept visualizations. In step six, I recommend that you create cognitive loops for yourself; they are loopy creatures. This means that the way our mind works and the way we can be creative is by externalizing our ideas, looking at them, discussing them, and through that, shaping them—seeing them in a different light. What can you do? Well, you can try out different concepts; you can try to draw some concepts, even if your drawing is not very good like mine. Creating a simple visual with your own hands will go a long way to triggering your creativity and coming up with ideas that you never thought you had. Somehow your hands think in a different way than your mind does. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

Also, try to share your ideas with others; show your visuals, get feedback, and through this looping, you will be able to refine the visual you're using. In step seven, I recommend that you continue to practice this process. Practice the process of coming up with the message, thinking through the synonyms and the keywords and the antonyms, and all the good stuff. Think through the type of visualizations you want to create—a scene, an image, a diagram, or whatever. Use the internet to get some inspiration— but then prioritize your own existing icons and an icon library for the sake of maximizing the connectivity by reuse within your Obsidian vault. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

Create cognitive loops; draw; share with others; look at what you've created; go back a couple of days later, and if you do all of these, then you will build up your muscle to come up with creative visual ideas. My process, my daily practice routine, is to take a daily quote and then use MidJourney to create a visual for that. In the Visual Thinking Virtual Discord server, in the Daily Quote channel, every day I share the visual I created, and sometimes I share some of the additional thoughts I had while creating the visual. Also, sometimes I get feedback; I get a discussion going with others in the community, looking at the visuals I created. I find this process to be a lot of fun, an excellent exercise in practicing how to think through what would be a good visual for the quote: what's the message for the quote, and how should I tell that quote? I think this is an excellent way to practice. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

Whatever your process for practicing, I think the bottom line is to practice, practice, and if you do that, eventually, you'll build up this muscle. So that is all I wanted to share in terms of the process. In closing, I'd like to leave you with a small exercise. I'm going to share a concept with you, and I ask you to think about how you would visualize this concept. Please, while you're working on your visualizations, pause the video and then come back and look at my solution and compare yours to mine, and let me know in the comments below what you found. Also, if you're a member of the Visual Thinking Workshop Discord server, then I ask you to post your solution in the chat, and let's have a discussion about why you chose the visualization that you chose and why I did what I did. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

The concept that I want to visualize is highlighted here: "To be an effective reader within disciplines, you must learn to identify for any given subject whether it is best understood as a system of supporting systems, such as math and science, or a system of conflicting systems, such as philosophy, psychology, and economics." [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

So this is the concept. Think of this as you're reading some texts within disciplines; you can see the beginning of the paragraph here as well if you need some context. Now pause the video, work out your visualization for this blue piece, and then when you're ready, continue the video. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

So welcome back. This is my solution. I decided to create two visuals for the two concepts. In my mind, the system of supporting systems is like a pulley system, where these different parts in the pulley system work together to help you lift a heavy weight. In case of a system of supporting systems, you need to master the systems to understand how they support each other. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

In case of systems of conflicting systems, in my mind, it is like a central point being pulled in several directions. It's like pulling rope, but you have multiple directions where force is applied to this central point, and the balance will move to wherever the sum of the forces will lead it to. In the case of systems of conflicting systems, you should explore how systems conflict with each other and how they overlap, and that will help you to better understand what you read and how it fits into the context. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

So that is my solution. Again, I'm super interested in the solution that you came up with. Please, in the comments or on the Discord server, share your ideas. Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco)

I discuss concept illustrations in this video and share my workflow for creating simple concept visuals. I explain that concept visualizations are functional representations of abstract concepts or ideas, typically consisting of images and text. I provide examples of simple visual metaphors and more abstract visualizations, highlighting their versatility. Concept visuals can be used in presentations, storytelling, marketing, and explaining concepts. I emphasize the importance of thinking about the message and using relevant keywords for searching images. I suggest building from existing icons and images before searching the internet, and I demonstrate how I use my icon library to support image reuse and serendipitous knowledge discovery. The goal is to make the message less boring, more memorable, and easily understandable for the audience.

presentations](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=208) [you can use them for storytelling you](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=211) [can use these visualizations in](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=214) [marketing you can use them to explain](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=216) [Concepts and probably lots of others](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=218) [why would you use them because these](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=222) [make your message a less boring B it is](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=225) [easier to remember when you can tie a](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=230) [topic to a Visual and finally it is](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=233) [easier to understand if you choose the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=236) [right visualizations then your message](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=238) [will be more easily conveyed to your](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=241) [audience](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=245) [now that we know what concept](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=246) [visualizations are and what they're used](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=248) [for let's look at how they are created](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=251) [using a simple workflow](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=254) [so this is the workflow I'm following](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=259) [this workflow has seven steps and we're](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=261) [going to walk through these seven steps](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=264) [but before we do that let's look at some](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=266) [of the things that you should not do](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=268) [don't wait for the Muse even the biggest](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=271) [artists start to work and as they work](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=274) [the idea emerges there are very few](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=278) [people if any who just sit down have](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=281) [this spark of an idea and come up with](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=285) [the most perfect visual to explain an](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=288) [idea it doesn't work like that it's not](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=291) [magic it is a process and sometimes it's](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=294) [hard to work so make sure you get to](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=298) [work instead of sit around waiting for](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=302) [the Muse or blame that the Muse never](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=304) [came there is no such thing as a muse in](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=307) [this case](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=310) [and also](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=313) [don't jump right into searching for](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=314) [stock images](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=318) [very often](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=319) [instead of thinking we have an idea we](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=321) [want to represent something and we jump](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=324) [in and start to search the web start to](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=327) [search PowerPoint Point icons whatever](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=330) [to find something that we can stick on](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=333) [that slide so we can convey our message](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=336) [don't do that](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=339) [because these typically lead to trivial](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=340) [ideas and in the end you will miss the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=345) [mark on conveying the intended message](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=348) [most often the message you want to](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=351) [convey is more nuanced than just a stock](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=354) [image would do or maybe a stock image](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=358) [can do but you need to find the right](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=362) [stock image don't just jump into](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=364) [searching right away but instead start](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=367) [by thinking of the message you want to](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=371) [convey so think through what is it that](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=375) [you want to tell with the picture what](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=378) [do you want the receiver of the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=382) [information to think feel after they've](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=385) [seen your Visual and heard your](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=389) [explanation](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=391) [and once you have this message in your](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=393) [mind then think of keywords that you](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=396) [could use for searching for images or](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=399) [illustrations and also think of synonyms](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=403) [and antonyms for that keyword because](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=406) [these can also be very helpful in](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=409) [finding the right](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=412) [visualization and this is a place where](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=414) [I use chai GPT very often jgbt is](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=417) [fantastic in coming up with synonyms](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=421) [antonyms as well as if you explain your](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=424) [message it can come up with keywords to](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=427) [support your search when you're](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=431) [searching for icons and images](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=433) [and if you want to be more creative you](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=435) [can also ask jgbt to recommend poems or](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=439) [fine art that conveys the message that](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=443) [you want to convey and the work from the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=447) [pictures or images in these creations](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=450) [and you can also think of or ask jgbt to](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=454) [help you with homonyms homophones](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=459) [homographs because these May trigger](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=461) [visual puns and may just put the whole](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=466) [idea into a completely different light](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=470) [which will help you find the right](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=472) [visualizations for the idea that you](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=476) [want to convey](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=479) [and once you have your keywords then](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=480) [think about the type of illustration](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=483) [that you need so it could be image and](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=486) [text as I explained earlier it may be](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=489) [that in the end it's a text only message](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=493) [that you want to convey so it's okay to](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=495) [have text and it's also okay to have](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=498) [text only if that's the best solution](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=501) [but it also could be a diagram or it](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=504) [could be a scene that you can compose](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=507) [using couple of different icons that](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=509) [will convey a situation a scene and in](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=512) [some cases If the message is simple or](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=516) [if you're for example doing user](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=519) [interface design then just a single](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=522) [image and icon is perfectly sufficient](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=524) [once you know the type of image you want](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=529) [the message you want and the keywords](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=532) [you want this is the time when you can](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=534) [start searching or when you should start](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=537) [searching looking on the internet](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=540) [looking for inspiration](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=542) [these are the typical places that I look](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=546) [I have a flat icon subscription and this](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=549) [is my number one go to place most of the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=553) [images that you see in this presentation](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=556) [as well come from Flat icon some of the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=558) [visualizations also in this presentation](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=562) [I created with my journey and I have a](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=564) [dedicated video I'm going to include in](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=567) [the video description that shows you how](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=570) [you can use my journey to generate](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=573) [custom SVG icons](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=575) [of course there's always Google and](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=578) [Google image search that's excellent for](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=581) [finding images as well as the noun](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=583) [project I'm going to include the link in](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=587) [the video description the noun project](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=589) [is a fantastic place if you're looking](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=592) [for icons and you're looking for](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=595) [creative ideas so I think these are the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=598) [basic go-to places apart from these you](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=601) [might want to go to various stock photo](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=605) [places and photos might also be a good](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=608) [way to get inspiration or simply use the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=611) [photo as your illustration](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=615) [but before using an icon or an image](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=619) [from the internet](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=624) [I recommend first building from your](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=626) [existing icons and images this is](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=631) [especially important if you work in a](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=634) [system like obsidian where you can use](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=637) [these images to connect ideas it is](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=640) [probably less important if you're](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=643) [creating PowerPoint presentations that](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=645) [are anyway disconnected](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=647) [but if you do this in obsidian then](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=650) [using the images will increase the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=654) [connectivity of the thoughts in your](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=657) [world so let me show you what I mean I](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=660) [have an image library and I have a](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=663) [dedicated video you'll find it as well](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=666) [in the video description how to create](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=668) [this image Library this is an icon](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=670) [library that searches my entire obsidian](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=673) [Vault and pulls out all the icons that I](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=679) [have in my Vault based on a naming](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=682) [convention and if I want to reuse an](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=685) [icon from here I can right click click](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=688) [copy and I can paste it into my drawing](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=691) [by pasting the icon from here it will](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=694) [not paste the image but will paste the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=698) [reference to the image and this way](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=701) [reuse the existing resource and connect](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=704) [to the existing resource and if you do](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=708) [this then with xcoli brain you will be](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=712) [able to](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=716) [see the connections between your](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=718) [thoughts using the icons so in this](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=721) [example what you can see here this is](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=725) [the x-coli brain](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=727) [screen for the concept visualizations](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=730) [summary presentation the concept map](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=732) [that we're looking at right now so](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=735) [that's in the center](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=737) [above the slide you have the sources the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=739) [parent nodes and below it you have the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=744) [child nodes in this case you can see](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=747) [that there are lots of attachments as](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=749) [child nodes these are the different](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=752) [images on the concept map and if you](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=754) [look close enough then you will see that](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=757) [each of these icons have a small number](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=760) [here at the top and also in some cases](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=763) [they have a small number on on the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=767) [bottom in this case I don't see it but](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=769) [here you can see that the central node](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=771) [has the small 37 and the four so what](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=774) [does it mean it means it has four](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=778) [parents and has 37 children](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=780) [and if I look at the children then I can](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=785) [see that for example the paper airplane](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=788) [has nine parents so this is an](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=791) [interesting example to look at so let's](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=795) [jump in and take a look at what this](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=798) [paper airplane there this paper airplane](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=802) [leads us to do that I need to click here](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=805) [on the paper airplane and when I click](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=808) [on the paper airplane then in the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=811) [background the paper airplane the image](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=814) [was opened and here in excalibrain I can](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=817) [see the paper airplane in the center and](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=821) [I can see the different](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=824) [documents where I've used this paper](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=827) [airplane so we can take a quick look at](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=829) [where I've used the paper airplane so](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=832) [for example I use the paper airplane in](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=835) [my book on a page summary for building a](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=839) [second brain and here it is used in this](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=843) [metaphor where Thiago says that the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=847) [reason I'm creating a mini summary of](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=849) [the book is because I'm packaging my](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=853) [learnings from the book and I'm sending](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=856) [it to my future self so this is what](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=859) [this represents right here](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=862) [but I'm also using the same paper](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=864) [airplane in how to take smart notes in](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=867) [the virtual cycle and you can see here](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=871) [that here again the paper airplane](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=874) [appears but as well as I use the paper](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=877) [airplane](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=881) [in digesting what you read so this was a](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=882) [recent video I published and you can see](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=886) [that at the end of the process at step 8](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=889) [I'm using the paper airplane to](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=894) [represent the activity of publishing and](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=896) [so on so you get the idea that by](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=900) [reusing the image I'm able to connect](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=904) [ideas within my obsidian Vault this is](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=908) [why I recommend that before going and](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=912) [looking for a brand new icon look at](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=916) [your icon library and think about which](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=920) [one could I repurpose how could I modify](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=923) [what I already have by adding another](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=927) [icon next to it or maybe just adding a](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=930) [line on top or something like that to](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=934) [make it](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=937) [usable for my specific purpose to convey](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=938) [my message so getting back to our story](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=942) [so back to Concept visualizations in](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=945) [Step six I recommend that you create](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=949) [cognitive Loops for yourself they are](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=952) [loopy creatures this means that the they](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=955) [are mind works and the way we are able](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=958) [to be creative is by externalizing our](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=961) [ideas looking at them discussing them](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=965) [and through that shaping them seeing](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=968) [them in a different light so what can](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=971) [you do well you can try out different](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=974) [concepts you can try to draw some](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=976) [Concepts even if your drawing is not](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=979) [very good like mine creating a simple](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=982) [visual with your own hands will go a](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=985) [long way to triggering your creativity](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=988) [and coming up with ideas that you never](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=992) [thought you had somehow your hands think](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=994) [in a different way than your mind does](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=998) [and also try to share your ideas with](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1000) [others show your visuals get feedback](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1004) [and through this looping you will be](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1007) [able to refine the visual that you're](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1009) [using](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1012) [and then step seven I recommend that you](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1014) [continue to practice this process](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1017) [practice the process of coming up with](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1020) [the message thinking through the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1023) [synonyms and the keywords and the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1025) [antonyms and all the good stuff thinking](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1028) [through the type of visualizations you](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1030) [want to create a scene an image a](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1033) [diagram or whatever](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1036) [use the internet to get some inspiration](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1038) [but then](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1041) [prioritize your own existing icons and](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1043) [icon library for sake of maximizing the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1047) [connectivity by reuse within your](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1051) [obsidian Vault and create cognitive](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1054) [Loops draw share with others look at](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1057) [what you've created go back a couple of](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1061) [days later and if you do all of these](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1063) [then you will build up your muscle to](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1066) [come up with creative visual ideas](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1069) [my process my daily practice routine is](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1072) [to take a daily quote and then use](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1077) [mid-journey to create a visual for that](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1080) [in the visual thinking virtual Discord](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1084) [server in the daily quote Channel every](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1087) [day I share the visual I created and](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1091) [sometimes I share some of the additional](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1094) [thoughts I had while creating the visual](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1097) [and also sometimes I get feedback I get](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1100) [a discussion going with others in the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1103) [community looking at the visuals I](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1106) [created I find this process a a lot of](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1108) [fun be an excellent exercise in](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1113) [practicing How to Think Through what](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1117) [would be a good visual for the quote](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1120) [what's the message for the quote how](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1122) [should I tell that quote I think this is](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1125) [an excellent way to practice but](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1129) [whatever your process for practicing](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1131) [I think the bottom line is to practice](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1135) [practice and if you do that eventually](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1138) [you'll build up this muscle](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1141) [so that is all I wanted to share in](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1145) [terms of the process in closing I'd like](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1149) [to leave you with a small exercise I'm](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1152) [going to share a concept with you and I](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1155) [ask you to think about how you would](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1158) [visualize this concept please while](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1161) [you're working on your visualizations](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1164) [pause the video and then come back and](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1167) [look at my solution and compare yours to](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1171) [mine and let me know in the comments](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1174) [below what you found also if you're a](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1176) [member of the visual thinking Workshop](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1180) [Discord server then I ask you to post](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1182) [your solution in the chat and let's have](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1186) [a discussion about why you chose the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1189) [visualization that you chose and why I](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1192) [did what I did](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1194) [so the concept that I want to visualize](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1197) [is the one that's highlighted here](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1199) [to Be an Effective reader within](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1202) [disciplines you must learn to identify](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1204) [for any given subject whether it is best](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1207) [understood as a system of supporting](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1210) [systems such as math and science or a](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1213) [system of conflicting systems such as](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1218) [philosophy psychology and economics](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1222) [so this is the concept think of this as](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1226) [you're reading some](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1230) [texts within disciplines you can see the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1232) [beginning of the paragraph here as well](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1235) [if you need some context](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1237) [and now pause the video work out your](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1239) [visualization for this blue piece and](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1243) [then when you're ready continue the](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1246) [video](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1249) [so welcome back](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1253) [this is my solution](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1255) [so I decided to create two visuals for](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1258) [the two concepts](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1262) [in my mind the system of supporting](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1264) [systems is like a pulley system where](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1267) [these different parts in the pulley](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1271) [system work together to help you lift a](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1274) [heavy weight in case of a system of](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1278) [supporting systems you need to master](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1281) [the systems to understand how they](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1283) [support each other](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1285) [in case of systems of conflicting](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1287) [systems](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1290) [in my mind it is like a central point](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1291) [being pulled in several directions it's](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1296) [like pulling rope but you have multiple](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1299) [directions where force is applied to](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1302) [this Central Point and the balance will](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1305) [move to wherever the sum of the forces](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1308) [will lead it to in case of systems of](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1311) [conflicting systems you should explore](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1315) [how systems conflict each other and how](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1317) [they overlap and that will help you to](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1321) [better understand what you read and how](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1324) [it fits into the context so that is my](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1328) [solution again I'm super interested in](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1331) [the solution that you came up with](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1334) [please in the comments or on the Discord](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1335) [server share your ideas](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1338) [thank you](https://youtu.be/MTdbhePtCco?t=1341)
