![Getting started with ExcaliBrain - starting from an empty Obsidian Vault (Part 1 of 3)](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt provides a comprehensive introduction to ExcaliBrain, an Obsidian plugin designed for visualizing connections in markdown documents through a structured graph. He walks viewers through the initial setup of a new Obsidian vault, including necessary plugins and the creation of a dialog map focused on remote work policy arguments. The tutorial aims to simplify the intimidating aspects of setting up ExcaliBrain while offering practical examples of argument mapping.

# Key Takeaways
- ExcaliBrain is an Obsidian plugin that visualizes connections in markdown documents via a structured graph.
- The tutorial emphasizes setting up an empty vault, installing essential plugins, and mapping arguments effectively using dialog mapping.
- Understanding the relationship between nodes, such as positions and questions, is crucial for effective graph formatting and visualization in ExcaliBrain.

Hey everyone, Zsolt here. ExcaliBrain is an Obsidian plugin that I've built to visualize connections described in your markdown documents in a structured graph. I realized that setting up ExcaliBrain can be a bit intimidating, and there are many settings that you need to get your head around, so I thought I would create this video that will take you through from a completely empty vault all the way to having something that looks like this. [* ](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=0)

Take you through a use case. The use case is going to be a relatively simple example; it's going to be an argument mapping, or rather a dialog mapping, example exploring the pros and cons of setting up a remote work policy at a company. So to give you a bit of frame, I think it's important to understand the framework that we're going to be applying here. I'm going to be using the issue-based Information Systems framework, which is a dialog mapping approach, and it consists of a couple of different components. It consists of issues that are typically phrased as questions, and this is how this is a dialog mapping because it drives a conversation about issues. Then there are positions, which are responses to these issues, and then there are supporting and objecting arguments that support or object to the positions. Finally, there are evidences that you can attach to various nodes, and at the end, you reach a conclusion that you can call a decision. [* ](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=29)

Now, if you're interested in learning more about IBIS, I have a video on it with another case study, and you might want to take a look at the "Visualizing Argumentation" book, which is the source of this. It's a bit of an old book, so it might be hard to find, but anyway, this is the book that you can look for that discusses the topic of argument mapping using IBIS. [* ](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=116)

So let's dive in. We're going to start by creating a brand new empty Obsidian Vault. I'm going to click here to create, and I'm going to type in the name ExcaliBrain. We're going to pick a location for this, which is this right here, and then I'm going to click Create. With this, we have a new vault. Now, to get ExcaliBrain working, you need to install three different plugins. So we'll go ahead and start with that. I'm going to click here on Obsidian settings, and here I'm going to click on Community plugins. In Community plugins, the first time you start Obsidian, you need to accept the risks and consequences of turning on community plugins, so I'm going to do that and I'm going to browse for the different plugins that we need. [* ](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=134)

First of all, you need to install Excalidraw, because ExcaliBrain is built on top of Excalidraw, which is another plugin that I've developed. After you've installed it, you need to click enable, and you can just close this message. Then next, we are going to click on DataView, and I'm going to install DataView as well. ExcaliBrain uses DataView to extract the structure of documents, so DataView is an essential component for ExcaliBrain to work. Finally, we're going to search for ExcaliBrain, and I'm going to click install as well. Once it's installed, I'm going to click enable on this plugin as well. So with this, we have the basic plugins installed and we can take a look at our plugins. You can see that we have DataView, ExcaliBrain, and Excalidraw. Now, it's important to keep in mind that ExcaliBrain builds on top of Excalidraw. One consequence of this is some of the settings in ExcaliBrain will depend on settings in Excalidraw. I'll show you one example when we get to that point, but this is something good to keep in mind, and maybe this is also a bit difficult at first to understand what is coming from Excalidraw and what's coming from ExcaliBrain, but hopefully, you'll get the hang of it. [* ](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=230)

So to get us started, I'm going to create the first document in the vault. I'm just simply going to click here to create a new note, and I'm going to title this note "Remote Work Policy." This is going to be the central question in our graph, in our dialog map, and I'm going to just close this one right here. Once I've created this document, I can now open ExcaliBrain. It's very easy to start ExcaliBrain; you need to open the command palette. I'm going to press Ctrl P; if you're on a Mac, this is Command P, and I'm going to type in "brain" and I'm going to choose "Brain Normal." Now "Brain Normal" opens in a new window within your workspace, and a brain pop-out will open in a pop-out window, but for now, we're going to be happy with "Brain Normal." So when I click enter, then you can see that now ExcaliBrain is open, and of course, right now we have a single document in the vault, and that is reflected here. You might also notice that I have a second document that was created; let's call it "Brain." You don't need to worry about it; this is the file that's underneath the brain view that you have here. You have nothing to worry about, but that's a file that's always going to be overwritten by ExcaliBrain, so I recommend not editing that file. [* ](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=404)

So now that we have this node here, we need to start to add children and items to it to help us move quicker. I'm going to use my cheat sheet, so I'm going to now paste here the question, the initial question: “Should the company implement a remote work policy?” I’m going to add the two positions here: one position is “yes” to remote work, and the other position is “no” to remote work. You can see that as I did this, the graph on the right-hand side started to develop. Now if I click on “Yes, the company should implement a remote work policy,” just to show you, this here is a Wiki link. So I have the first part of the link as the file name, and then after the pipe character, I have the alias for this file that's being displayed right there. If I click on this link, then that creates this new file. So this is now created; this is “Yes to Remote Work Policy.” You can see on the right-hand side that the diagram has changed. So “Yes to Remote Work” is now in the center. It has a parent, which is the “Remote Work Policy,” and it also has a distant relation, which is this other position here, which is “No to Remote Work.” [* ](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=503)

Now, I'm just going to copy this material over here as well to fill this in. This is going to be a position, and notice what I'm doing here. So at the top, I'm adding this tag, so I'm going to zoom in so you can better see. So I have a tag here that is called “Position,” and here as well when I clicked the “Remote Work Policy,” you can see that this had a tag “Question” at the top. We are going to use these to format the nodes. Also, what you will notice is “Yes to Remote Work” now looks different compared to “No to Remote Work.” The difference is that this note has been created, and this doesn’t yet exist in the vault, and ExcaliBrain can format it differently. This is actually a super good feature because this way you can also see connections between nodes that are not yet in your vault. But you also notice that this now looks different compared to the example I showed in the beginning. First of all, you see the dashed line, and the items are under the central item, not to the right, and also the coloring and the look and feel is different. So what do we do about this? We're going to come to the plugin settings, and we're going to start to play a bit with ExcaliBrain settings so you can see how you can format this. So first of all, I'm going to click here on settings, and I'm going to click here on ExcaliBrain. You have lots of settings here; for the time being, we are not going to touch these. I'm going to come all the way down to styling, and first of all, we're going to add these two tags that we've created. So one was the “Question” and the other one was the “Position.” [* ](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=579)

So we need to manually add the tags that we want to use for formatting purposes, and once I've added the text here, then I can choose here in this, and I need to add a comma in between. So it’s “Question, Position.” And once I've added them, then the items will appear here. So if you noticed when I don't have a comma, then these two items appear in a single row. That's not good; you need to add your comma right here. Once I have the comma there, then I can start to format this for the Question. All I want is a question mark at the beginning of the question. So, the way this works, and this might be a bit hard to comprehend at the beginning, is everything is inherited from the base note style. So the base note style, you can see all the settings of the base note style; lots of different settings. If I create a new node type, for example, “Position,” by default everything is inherited. If I turn this switch, then I'm only going to see the non-inherited items, which in this case is nothing because this is already the next section. So to customize the Position, I first need to flip the switch to customize the prefix. So I'm going to flip the switch, and with this, I tell ExcaliBrain that the Position will look exactly the same as the base note style, except that the prefix is going to be different. I’m going to bring up the emoji toolbar, and I'm going to choose this light bulb. So for me, a Position is represented by an idea, and I also want to change the background color of the idea node. So I'm going to turn the background color switch on as well. I'm going to change the opacity; so this is the transparency of the node, 200 percent, and I'm going to choose a different color. I'm going to try to choose a nice dark yellow color, somewhere like this. I'm happy with this color; maybe a bit yellower like that. So there you can see how the new format or new node looks like. This actually doesn't look very good, so we're going to look for a darker yellow. Maybe even, yeah, this is going to be good, so I'm going to choose this orange-red color. [* ](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=710)

So with this, I formatted the Position, and then I'm also going to format the Question node. For the Question node, I'm only going to add a prefix, and the prefix is going to be this question mark like this. And now when I close settings, then what you will see is the formatting for the “Remote Work Policy” is now indeed a question. I wonder why we had an issue with the Position. So this is spelled correctly; maybe I have an issue here with the letter case. Oh no, it's with the spelling. So now I corrected the spelling. Unfortunately, after I correct the spelling, I need to redo my settings. So the Position is going to be this light bulb, and I'm going to set the color to again this orange-red like I set it, like this. To this orange-red like this. And then when I close this, then you can see that now we have the formatting like this. Yeah, so this is not an ideal formatting; maybe we should change the font color of the Position item as well. So here I can again scroll down to styling; I can choose “Position,” and I also want to change the text color, and I wanted the text color to be black. I think with that now the Position looks much nicer. Now you can also notice that “No to Remote Work” is still not yellow, and that's because there is no document, so there is no tag, and if there is no tag, then there's no Style. But we can do something about it, so we are going to create this document right here. What I'm going to do is here in ExcaliBrain, if I hold down the Shift key and click on a node, then I'm prompted with this question if I want to create a new markdown document or a UX Excalidraw file. So I'm going to say I want to create a new markdown document. So this “No to Remote Work” file was now created, and I'm going to just copy in the contents of “No to Remote Work,” so we're going to have the position, then the title of the question, and then the supporting argument. And now you can see that at least we got the colors right, but the locations are still not good. I mean the Positions are under the central question, and I want them to be on the right-hand side, so we still need to do some things. So you can see here in this row that I have something that's going on here. I have here “Position,” and I have double colons here, and then I have the name of the file. This right here, this “Position::” is called a DataView field, and ExcaliBrain is using these fields to understand the ontology, which is the description of connections between items. So this describes the relationship between this document, the question, and this item here, which is a Position. [* ](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=876)

So to make ExcaliBrain recognize this ontology, you have two options. So first of all, I'm going to just right-click here. In this line, if I right-click, then you will see this menu item in the context menu "Add Position to ExcaliBrain Ontology." When I click this, then I can choose what sort of relationship this is going to have with the central node. Now, I don't want to go into the details of these different types of nodes. Later on, we can touch on it, and also I have other videos that will explain. For now, just believe me that this should be a "Next Friend." The nature of a "Next" and "Previous Friend" is that it's a relative position compared to the center because the next is to the right of the central node. When it’s still next but when they move, then it comes to the left. For the "Next" node, it's to the right side, and for left side and right side friends, they always stay on the right and left side, regardless of the two nodes moving to the center. [* ](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1035)

I'm sure that this was completely gibberish to you, but I think let me show you how "Next" works, and then later on we can also look at "Left Side Friends" and "Right Side Friends." A good example for that, and I'm going to include that in the video description, is the "Compass of Zettelkasten," and I have an ExcaliBrain video about that, and that explains, I think, much better the right and left side friends. But for now, I'm going to click here on "Next Friends," and when I do that, you see that ExcaliBrain already recognized that these should be on the right-hand side. You can also see that the line is now a solid line, not a dashed line, and that's because the dashed line means it’s an inferred relationship. I infer the relationship because there is a link in the document, and then I infer that the two have some relationship with one another. The moment I explicitly state in the ontology what the relationship is, so it's a Position, from that moment on this comes to the right-hand side. [* ](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1204)

So I think we're going to stop here for part one. I'm going to continue on with part two, and you can tune into part two, but I think so far I've already shared enough video that I recommend that you create a new Obsidian vault, you download these three plugins, and you play with these settings that we've looked at until now, and then you come back for part two, where we are going to continue with the customization of the settings as well as we're going to continue to build this ExcaliBrain. Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1246)

[scholarly brain uses data view to](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=228) [extract the structure of documents so](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=231) [data view is an essential component for](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=234) [xcoli brain to work and finally we're](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=236) [going to search for excellent brain and](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=239) [I'm going to click install as well and](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=242) [once it's installed I'm going to click](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=246) [enable on this plugin as well so with](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=248) [this we have the basic plugins installed](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=252) [and we can take a look at our plugin so](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=256)

that](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=264) [excalib brain Builds on top of X column](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=267) [draw one consequence of this is some of](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=271) [the settings in excalib brain will](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=275) [depend on settings in X call it raw I'll](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=278) [show you one example when we get to that](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=281) [point but this is something good to keep](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=284) [in mind and maybe this is also a bit](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=286) [difficult at first to understand what is](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=290) [coming from scholar draw and what's](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=293) [coming from a scholar brain but](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=294) [hopefully](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=296) [you'll get the hang of it so to get us](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=297) [started I'm going to create a first](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=300) [document in the vault I'm just simply](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=303) [going to click here to create a new node](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=305) [and I'm going to title this note remote](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=308) [work policy this is going to be the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=312) [central question in our graph in our](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=315) [dialog map and I'm going to just close](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=320) [this one right here once I've created](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=323) [this document I can now open excoli](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=327) [Brain it's very easy to start excoli](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=330) [brain you need to open the

going to type in brain and I'm going](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=341) [to choose brain normal now brain normal](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=344) [opens in a new window within your](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=347) [workspace and a brain pop out will open](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=350) [in a pop-out window but for now we're](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=355) [going to be happy with brain normal so](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=358) [when I click](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=361) [enter Then you can see that now excalib](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=363) [brain is open and of course right now we](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=366) [have a single document in the vault and](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=369) [that is reflected here now you might](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=373) [also notice that here I have a second](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=376) [document that was created let's call it](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=379) [brain you don't need to worry about it](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=381) [this is the file that's underneath the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=384) [brain file or view that you have here](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=388) [you have not to worry about it but](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=392) [that's a file that's always going to be](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=394) [overwritten by x-coli brain so I](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=397) [recommend not editing that file so now](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=400) [that we have this node here we need to](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=403) [start to add children and items to it to](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=407) [help us move quicker I'm going to use my](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=410) [cheat sheet so I'm going to now paste](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=413) [here the question the initial question](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=416) [so should the company Implement a remote](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=420) [work policy and I'm going to add the two](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=423) [positions here](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=426) [one position is a yes to remote work the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=428) [other position is a no to remote work](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=432) [and you can see that as I did this the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=436) [graph on the right hand side started to](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=439) [develop now if I click on yes the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=443) [company should Implement a remote work](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=447) [policy just to show you so this here is](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=450) [a Wiki link so I have the first part of](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=452) [the link is the file name and then after](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=455) [the pipe character I have the Alias for](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=458) [this file what's being displayed right](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=462) [there if I click on this link then that](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=464) [creates this new file so this is now](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=468) [created this is yes to remote work](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=471) [policy you can see on the right hand](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=474) [side the diagram has changed so yes to](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=477) [remote work is now in the center it has](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=480) [a parent which is remote or policy and](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=484) [it also has a distant relation which is](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=487) [this other position here which is the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=491) [node to remote](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=495) [now if I'm just going to copy this](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=497) [material over here as well to fill this](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=500) [in so this is going to be a position and](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=503) [notice what I'm doing here so at the top](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=506) [I'm adding this tag so I'm going to zoom](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=510) [in so you can better see so I have](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=514) [attack here which is called position and](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=516) [here as well when I clicked the remote](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=520) [work policy you can see that this had a](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=523) [tag question at the top](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=526) [we are going to use these to format the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=530) [nodes also what you will notice is yes](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=533) [to remote work now looks different](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=537) [compared to node to remote work the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=539) [difference is that this note has been](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=542) [created and this doesn't yet exist in](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=544) [the vault](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=548) [and X call your brain can format it](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=549) [differently this is actually a super](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=552) [good feature](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=553) [because this way you can](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=555) [also see connections between nodes that](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=559) [are not yet in your vault](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=562) [but you also notice that this now looks](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=566) [different compared to the example I](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=568) [showed in the beginning first of all you](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=571) [see the dashed line and the items are](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=573) [under the central item not to the right](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=577) [and also the coloring and the look and](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=580) [feel is different so what do we do about](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=583) [this we're going to come to plug-in](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=587) [settings and we're going to start to](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=589) [play a bit with excalibrain settings so](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=592) [you can see how you can format this so](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=595) [first of all I'm going to click here on](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=598) [settings and I'm going to click here on](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=601) [excali brain](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=604) [you have lots of settings here for the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=606) [time being](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=608) [we are not going to touch these I'm](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=609) [going to come all the way down to](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=612) [styling and first of all we're going to](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=615) [add these two tags that we've created so](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=618) [one was the question and the other one](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=621) [was the position](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=624) [so we need to manually add the tags that](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=627) [we want to use](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=631) [for formatting purposes and once I've](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=632) [added the text here then I can choose](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=635) [here in this and I need to add a comma](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=638) [in between](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=642) [so it's question comma position and once](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=644) [I've added them then the items will](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=648) [appear here so if you noticed when I](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=650) [don't have a comma then these two items](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=654) [appear in a single row that's not good](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=657) [you need to add your comma right here](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=660) [and once I have the comma there then I](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=664) [can start to format this for the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=667) [question all I want is a question mark](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=670) [at the beginning of the question so the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=674) [way this works and this might be a bit](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=678) [hard to comprehend at the beginning is](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=682) [everything is inherited from the base](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=686) [note style so the base note style you](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=690) [can see all the settings of the bass](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=693) [notes style lots of different settings](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=695) [if I create a new node type for example](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=698) [position by default everything is](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=701) [inherited if I turn this switch then I'm](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=705) [only going to see the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=709) [non-inherited items which in this case](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=712) [is nothing because this is already the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=715) [next section so to customize the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=717) [position I first need to flip the switch](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=719) [to customize the prefix](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=722) [so I'm going to flip the switch with](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=726) [this I tell let's call it brain that the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=728) [position will look exactly the same as](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=731) [the base note style except that the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=734) [prefix is going to be different and I'm](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=738) [going to bring up the Emoji toolbar and](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=740) [I'm going to choose this light bulb so](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=744) [for me a position is represented by an](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=747) [idea and I also want to change the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=751) [background color of the idea node so I'm](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=754) [going to turn the background color](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=759) [switch on as well](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=762) [I'm going to change the opacity so this](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=764) [is the transparency of the node 200](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=767) [percent and I'm going to choose](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=770) [a different color I'm going to try to](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=773) [choose a nice dark yellow color](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=776) [somewhere like this I'm happy with this](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=779) [color maybe a bit bit yellower like that](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=784) [so there you can see how the new format](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=789) [or new node looks like this actually](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=792) [doesn't look that very good so we're](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=794) [going to look for a darker yellow Maybe](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=796) [maybe even yeah ah this is going to be](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=801) [good so I'm going to choose this orange](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=804) [red color](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=808) [so with this I formatted the position](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=810) [and then I'm also going to format the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=812) [question node and for the question node](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=816) [I'm only going to add a prefix and the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=819) [prefix is going to be this question mark](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=821) [like this](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=825) [and now when I close](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=828) [settings then what you will see is the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=830) [formatting for the remote work policy is](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=835) [now indeed a question I wonder why we](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=839) [have an issue with the position so this](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=844) [is spelled correctly maybe I have an](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=847) [issue here with the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=850) [letter case](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=853) [oh no it's with the spelling](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=856) [so now](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=860) [I corrected the spelling unfortunately](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=861) [after I collect correct the spelling I](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=864) [need to redo my settings so the position](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=867) [is going to be this light bulb and I'm](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=870) [going to set the color to](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=874) [again this orange red](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=877) [like](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=881) [I set it like this to this orange red](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=883) [like this](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=889) [and then when I close this then you can](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=891) [see that now we have the formatting like](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=893) [this yeah so this is not an ideal](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=897) [formatting maybe we should change the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=900) [font color of the position item as well](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=903) [so here I can again scroll down to](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=907) [styling I can choose position and I also](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=910) [want to change the text color and I](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=914) [wanted the text color to be black and I](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=917) [think with that now the position looks](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=921) [much nicer now you can also notice that](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=923) [no to remote work is still not yellow](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=927) [and that's because there is no document](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=931) [so there is no tag and if there is no](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=933) [tag then there's no Style](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=936) [but we can do something about it so we](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=939) [are going to create this document right](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=942) [here what I'm going to do is here in](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=944) [excali brain if I hold down the shift](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=947) [key and click on a node then I'm](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=950) [prompted with this question if I want to](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=953) [create a new markdown document or a ux](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=955) [collateral file so I'm going to say I](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=958) [want to create a new markdown document](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=961) [so this node to remote work file was now](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=964) [created and I'm going to just copy in](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=968) [the contents of node to remote work so](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=971) [we're going to have the position then](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=975) [the title of the question and then the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=977) [supporting argument](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=980) [and now you can see that at least we got](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=982) [the colors right but the locations are](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=985) [still not good I mean the positions are](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=988) [under the central question and I want](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=993) [them to the beat on the right hand side](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=996) [so we still need to do some things so](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=998) [you can see here in this row that I have](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1002) [something that's going on here so I have](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1005) [here position and I have double double](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1008) [columns here and then I have the name of](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1012) [the file this right here this position](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1015) [double colon is called an data view](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1019) [field and excally brain is using these](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1024) [fields to understand](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1028) [the ontology which is the description of](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1030) [connections between items so this is](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1034) [what describes the relationship between](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1038) [this document question and this item](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1041) [here which is a position](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1045) [so to make X call the brain recognize](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1047) [this ontology](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1051) [there's you have two options so first of](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1054) [all I'm going to just right click here](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1057) [so in this line if I right click then](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1060) [you will see this](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1063) [menu item in the context menu add](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1065) [position to x-color brain ontology when](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1068) [I click this then I can choose what sort](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1072) [of relationship this is going to have](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1075) [with the central node now I don't want](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1079) [to go into the details of these](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1081) [different type of nodes](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1084) [later on we can touch on it and also I](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1086) [have other videos that will explain for](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1090) [now](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1092) [I just believe me that this should be a](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1094) [next friend the nature of a next and](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1097) [previous friend is it's a relative](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1101) [position compared to the center because](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1103) [the next is to the right of the central](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1106) [node when it's still next but when they](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1111) [move then it becomes it comes to the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1114) [left because then](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1117) [for the next node it's the previous](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1119) [while the left side and right side](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1122) [friends always stay on the right and the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1125) [left side regardless of the two nodes](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1128) [moving to the center](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1132) [I'm sure that this was completely](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1135) [gibberish to you but I think let me show](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1137) [you how next works and then later on we](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1140) [can also look at left side friends and](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1142) [right side friends a good example for](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1145) [that and I'm going to include that in](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1147) [the video description is the compass of](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1150) [zettel cost and I have an ex-coli brain](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1154) [video about that and that explains I](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1156) [think much better the right and left](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1159) [side friends but for now I'm going to](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1162) [click here on next friends and when I do](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1164) [that you see that x-coli brain already](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1168) [recognized](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1171) [that these should be on the right hand](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1173) [side and you can also see that the line](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1176) [is now a solid line not a dashed line](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1179) [and that's because the dashed line means](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1183) [it's an inferred relationship I infer](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1186) [the relationship because there is a link](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1189) [in the document and then I infer that](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1192) [the two have some relationship with one](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1195) [another the moment I explicitly state in](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1199) [the ontology](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1202) [what the relationship is so it's a](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1204) [position](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1207) [from that moment on this comes to the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1208) [right hand side](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1212) [so I think](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1214) [we're going to stop here](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1216) [for part one I'm going to continue on](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1219) [with part two and you can tune into part](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1221) [two but I think so far I've already](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1225) [shared enough video that I recommend](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1227) [that you create a new obsidian vault](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1231) [you download these three plugins and you](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1234) [play with these settings that we've](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1237) [looked at until now and then you come](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1239) [back for part two where we are going to](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1241) [continue with the customization of the](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1244) [settings as well as we're going to](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1249) [continue to build this x color brain](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1252) [thank you](https://youtu.be/8LE_QdYQZVk?t=1255)
