![Part 1: Circle Map - Thinking Maps with Excalidraw in Obsidian](https://youtu.be/EgDOZaAZsKc)

# Summary
In this video, the presenter introduces the concept of Thinking Maps, a visual language that helps organize thoughts and ideas. Specifically, the focus is on the Circle Map, which is utilized to define concepts and their context. The presenter outlines essential thinking skills associated with effective use of the Circle Map, emphasizing a structured approach to enhancing cognitive processing.

# Key Takeaways
- Thinking Maps, created by David Hurley, consist of eight distinct maps for various thinking tasks.
- The Circle Map serves to define concepts and is framed by an essential question.
- Key thinking skills include contextual understanding, classification, sequencing, and recognizing cause and effect.

Thinking maps is a visual language of eight thinking process maps developed by David Hurley. Each map addresses a specific thinking task, like a language. Thinking maps are flexible and can be combined to fit your thinking context. This is part one of this series to introduce the eight maps plus the frame that serves as a tool for self-reflection. I'll be releasing one video each day, so subscribe to get notified. [* ](https://youtu.be/EgDOZaAZsKc?t=0)

The Circle Map is designed to define concepts and context, developing a frame of reference. As a rule of thumb, the Circle Map will feature nouns around the central statement. Each of the eight thinking maps has a frame. This is the frame of reflection. You start by drawing the frame and by articulating the essential question—the question you are looking to answer—at the top of the frame. We will return to the frame in a later video.

Let's say you wanted to improve your thinking. What skills would you need to focus on? What are fundamental thinking skills? They are the ability to define context, the classification of things, sequencing of ideas, activities or timelines, comparing and contrasting ideas and concepts, the skill of taking things apart and organizing the parts of a whole, being able to see analogies, describing and characterizing things, and finally understanding cause-and-effect relations. [* ](https://youtu.be/EgDOZaAZsKc?t=65)

Let's look at another example: How would you describe Excalidraw to a friend? What do you use Excalidraw for? You could use it to illustrate ideas, tell stories, design solutions, help you think more visually, and to collaborate with others via a shared virtual whiteboard. [* ](https://youtu.be/EgDOZaAZsKc?t=102)

Finally, let's use a Circle Map to enlist the eight thinking maps. Notice how in this example, I'm adding Obsidian wiki links around the central statement. This way, my Circle Map immediately becomes a virtual map of content that I can use as a jumping board to access further notes and drawings in my vault. The eight thinking maps are the Circle Map to define context, the Bubble Map to describe attributes, the Double Bubble Map to compare and contrast, the Tree Map for classifying things, the Brace Map to describe parts of a whole, the Flow Map to think about sequence, the Multi-Flow Map to explore cause and effect, and finally, the Bridge Map for seeing analogies.

This concludes the introduction of the Circle Map that you can use to define concepts and context. In the next video, we will cover Bubble Maps. Don't forget to subscribe so you are notified when part 2 is released. Thank you for watching. [* ](https://youtu.be/EgDOZaAZsKc?t=188)
