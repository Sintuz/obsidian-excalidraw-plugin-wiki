![Obsidian Excalidraw 1.5.17 - Forth Font for Text Elements](https://youtu.be/eKFmrSQhFA4)

# Summary
In this video, the creator introduces a new feature in Obsidian Excalidraw that allows users to add a fourth font, responding to community requests. He explains how to enable this feature while also highlighting the potential trade-offs concerning platform independence. The tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to select and install custom fonts to enhance the drawing experience.

# Key Takeaways
- Users can now enable a fourth font in Obsidian Excalidraw, though it may affect platform independence.
- The feature is turned off by default and must be activated through settings.
- Custom fonts can be downloaded from websites like Google Fonts and stored in a designated fonts folder within your Obsidian vault.

One of the first feature requests that I received when I launched Obsidian Excalidraw back in April last year was to add the option for a fourth font. I held back on this request for a long time because I was afraid of losing backwards compatibility. In the meantime, I learned quite a lot about how Excalidraw works, and I see that this risk is not so high after all. Now, with some help from the community, I have this new feature available in Excalidraw. [* ](https://youtu.be/eKFmrSQhFA4?t=0)

By default, the feature is going to be turned off, so you need to go to settings, then to Excalidraw, and you need to go down to experimental features. Here at the bottom, you will see the option to enable the fourth font. It is turned off by default because you will lose some of the platform independence. Once you turn this on, your drawings will no longer look exactly the same when you open them in Excalidraw.com. They will still open, but the fourth font will not look the same. Also, this is a single font for your entire vault, so if you save a file with the font and then you change the font, the way that file looks will change as well. In the end, I think this is not so much an issue; you can set your fourth font that you really love and then stick to it, and this is going to work. [* ](https://youtu.be/eKFmrSQhFA4?t=35)

So, you need to set or turn this feature on, and then you need to select a font file. By default, you will only see the Virgil font available on the list, and for the other files, you need to download and install them into Obsidian. So how do you do that? In my case, I've downloaded these files to the fonts folder. I created a folder in my vault called "fonts" and placed these font files there to display. You may need to go to files and links and select "detect all file extensions"; otherwise, Obsidian only displays files that it recognizes, and font files, by default, it doesn't. [* ](https://youtu.be/eKFmrSQhFA4?t=88)

Once you have this enabled and you have your fonts directory, you can go to a website like Fonts.Google.com, and you can select the font you want. So let's say I would like to use this font in my vault and in my drawings. I can click on this font and click "Download font family." When the download is ready, you will need to unpack the file. So let me just unpack it and let's look for the folder. Hereâ€™s the font file itself. What I need to do with this font is drop it into Obsidian, into my fonts folder. The font has appeared, and then I can go to settings, Excalidraw, scroll down, and see the font has appeared. Then I can select the font. From then on, I'm using this font in Excalidraw.

And that's about it! I hope you will enjoy this new feature. I'm very excited that I finally can provide this feature based on all those requests. Thank you! [* ](https://youtu.be/eKFmrSQhFA4?t=206)
