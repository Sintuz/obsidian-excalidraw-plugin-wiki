# Content
I launched cohort one of the visual thinking workshop two years ago; it was one hell of a learning journey. Today, I'm proud to announce that I'm launching the Visual Thinking Workshop self-paced course. This course contains 12 and a half hours of hands-on video. I'm taking you through the study of "The Extended Mind" by Annie Murphy Paul, a book that is super relevant to the topic of spatial visual thinking. Of course, the course includes my demo vault with six Book on a Page examples, complete with literature notes and everything, and a whole lot more. On top of this, I'm adding a couple of offers if you want to have a deeper learning experience. I'm adding office hours, one-on-one coaching, and I'll still keep the cohort experience. Indeed, as part of this launch, I'm hosting a special cohort, Cohort 11, which is going to take you through "The Extended Mind" alongside the self-paced course. I thought I would make this launch a bit playful, so I invited ChatGPT to interview me about the course and ask me a couple of challenging questions. Let me know how you like this approach. So let's play a game. I'm launching the Visual Thinking Workshop self-paced course this week. First, ask me a couple of questions about the workshop, and then ask me some challenging, more skeptical questions that come to mind, one by one. [* ](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s)

Sure, let's get started. First, can you tell me what the main goal of the Visual Thinking Workshop is? What can participants expect to gain from it? From a practical perspective, the main goal of the workshop is to take you through the process of reading a book, creating a Book on a Page summary, and then adding visual elements or permanent notes to your knowledge management system. From a broader perspective, the objective of the workshop is to use this Book on a Page approach to help you build some visual thinking skills, including illustration skills, linking and thinking skills, and storytelling skills as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s)

That sounds interesting! So how do you ensure that participants actually apply what they learn? Are there any specific exercises or activities built into the course to encourage that? Yes, the course takes you through "The Extended Mind" by Annie Murphy Paul, and by the way, the book is super relevant to the topic of thinking spatially and using visuals as an external extension of our thinking. Throughout the course, I work with you, the participant, as we go through the book. I am also creating illustrations, showing you different approaches, and crafting my storyline. Along the journey, there are 49 lessons in total and there are almost 40 different exercises. Almost every lesson ends with a practical exercise that you need to do based on what we discussed in the lesson and based on your reading experience of "The Extended Mind." [* ](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s)

That's great to hear! But I have to ask, what makes your course different from other visual thinking courses out there? Why should someone choose this one over the many others available? Frankly, I don't think that there are many others available. Yes, there are illustration courses, and yes, there are personal knowledge management courses like Building a Second Brain or Linking Your Thinking by Nick Milo, but there are no courses that I know of that are visual thinking courses in the sense of personal knowledge management. I take you through the process of how you can work with visuals similar to text. You can link them, reference them, deconstruct them into smaller pieces, and reference them that way. It is a full methodology and workflow for creating a 100% visual personal knowledge management system. Text is still present, of course; I am not against text. In fact, I think that a picture speaks a thousand words only if you think or say those words. So words are super important, but I think my course is 100% unique. There's nothing like it in terms of connecting your visual ideas and creating a four-dimensional interactive knowledge management system centered around visuals. [* ](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s)

That sounds interesting! But how can I be sure that this course will actually help me improve my visual thinking skills? What kind of results can I realistically expect after completing it? I have two parts to my answer here. Part one is: if you think about your education and your upbringing, then the school system—at least the one I went to—prioritized writing and reading over illustrations and visual thinking. In fact, we had art class, and that was it; everything else was about reading and writing. So in my view, if you think again about what you did first—did you draw first when you were a child, or did you write first? And of course, the answer is you drew first. So then there's the question of nature versus nurture—what will be nurtured to work on? My argument is that if you invest more time into writing courses, you're going to improve, of course, but it's going to be a small improvement. If you invest in visual thinking courses, then because they have not had the nurturing throughout our schooling, I think there is going to be a step change that you can achieve. What I can promise you is you'll have a completely different thinking about how illustrations work. You'll stop thinking about them as something you place in the resources folder and that you just have images that are sort of resources, to images becoming the actual ideas or the representation of ideas. Maybe just one more thought here: I heard this thought from Elon Musk when he was talking about Neuralink and discussing the effective bit rate. He mentioned that the effective bit rate of language is extremely slow, and I argue that the effective bit rate—or let's say the compression you can achieve with visuals—is much higher. If you do visuals well, then it will elevate the depth of your thinking because you'll be able to work with larger concepts quicker. And I think, of course, I cannot promise that by the end of the course you achieve all of these, but I can definitely promise that by the end of the course, you are going to be thinking differently about illustrations and about their role in your knowledge management note-taking system. [* ](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s)

That makes sense. But I still have concerns about the practical application. How can I integrate what I learn in this course into my existing knowledge management system? Will it work with tools I'm already using, or will I have to change my entire setup? The course does use Obsidian and Obsidian Excalidraw and Excalibrain as the base tools. It is true that I've searched for many years— I would say for 25 years— I've been searching for a visual thinking tool. I tried lots of tools like mind mapping tools, different drawing tools, and things like OneNote, etc. But frankly, I didn't find the tool I was looking for, and that's why I created the Obsidian Excalidraw plugin. Yes, some of the concepts that I explain are Obsidian Excalidraw specific; however, I also believe that the basic mindset of thinking visually and the use of visuals is tool agnostic. I would say that at least 80% of what the course is about can be applied to a broad range of knowledge management tools. The other thing I would highlight is that the course is not only applicable to personal knowledge management. I believe that thinking is communication—communicating our ideas with others or with ourselves to create feedback loops. As Ann Paul says, we are loopy creatures, and illustrations creating drawings are an important feedback loop. So I think this skill of thinking visually will influence how you work, how you do other parts of your life, and the other aspect here is visual storytelling. Just think of a presentation you do at work; it is visual storytelling. Your slide is the card forcing function. If you look at the mindset framework that I'm teaching, you need to tell a story, and I believe that the same approaches, the same concepts about storytelling, illustration design, and creating meaningful concept visuals that are not trivial icons but actually convey the message you want to convey are relevant to professional presentations, not just in Excalidraw and Obsidian but in tools like PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Keynote. They are all tools where you can implement similar approaches. [* ](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s)

That's reassuring to hear. But I'm still wondering about the long-term benefits. How do I know that the skills I learn in this workshop will stick with me after the course is over? What kind of support do you offer after I complete the course to help reinforce what I've learned? There's going to be a community—a Discord community. Anyone signing up for the course will automatically become part of that community. So one of my approaches is to have that community in place. The second approach is I see the Visual Thinking Workshop self-paced course as an entry course, if you will, and I will continue to have cohort-based courses. The cohort-based course is going to focus on the practical application of these approaches. Instead of teaching the basics, we are going to take a book; it’s going to be like a visual book club, and from book to book, we are going to go through the process of creating illustrations, creating stories, creating permanent notes, and going through all the practices: concept maps, mind maps, research around it. [* ](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s)

That sounds promising! But what if I struggle with some of the concepts during the self-paced course? Is there a way to get help or ask questions if I'm having difficulty? The self-paced course is going to come with a couple of additional options or offers. One of them is to sign up for two months of office hours. Office hours are going to happen every second week, and there's going to be an hour where those people who are subscribed to those office hours can come and ask questions. It's going to be an interactive session with me, by the way. I'm going to have one for the East time zone, so Asia, and one for the Americas and Europe, with alternating weeks. So if someone joins from the East time zone, they will have an opportunity to have a dialogue with me as well. That’s one of the options I’m adding to the workshop. The other option I'm adding is a one-on-one coaching option that people can subscribe to, and if they do, they'll have an option of setting up a 1-hour slot with me to dive into their immediate issues and questions. On top of all this, as I'm launching the course, I'm going to run Cohort 11 as a unique and special cohort. In Cohort 11, we're going to read "The Extended Mind," so we are going to work through the self-paced course together. This is an awesome opportunity, I think, in terms of having the self-paced course at hand but also having these cohort-based sessions where we actually practice the material in the book. I'm also super excited because I want to read "The Extended Mind" again, so it’s a good book, and I want to go through it with a cohort and have those discussions. I think that’s going to be a special opportunity now as I’m launching the course, but later on as well. I'm offering a cohort option next to the course, so people who take the self-paced course can opt in or buy an option to participate in a future cohort and use that as an opportunity to deepen their understanding. [* ](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s)

That sounds like a great support system. But what if someone feels that the content isn't meeting their expectations or needs? Do you have a refund policy or any way for participants to voice their concerns about the course? I'm definitely there to listen—absolutely! Discord is one way of contacting me. I think those who have worked with me know that I am super responsive to anyone's issues, and I try to do everything in my power to help you, even those who are not participating in the course. Just look at my YouTube channel; my plugin that I'm offering free of charge is, I think, the best visual thinking tool available that you can get without paying for it. So I am absolutely open to sharing. There is no refund policy, however, because when you purchase the course, you essentially purchase my intellectual property. This is why I sort of split this offer into separate parts—so you can purchase the course with the demo vault. We haven’t yet talked about the demo vault. The demo vault is a super important part of the entire package. In the demo vault, you get seven Book on a Page examples, complete with full literature notes, book on a pages with icons, you get almost 7,400 icons, and you also get an article on a page, some zettelkasten notes, and you get my mindset cards—all of them, or 35 of them—with lots of background information. So with the demo vault, you also get my templating scripts. You get huge value with the demo vault itself. Many of the participants earlier have commented that the demo vault itself was worth the price of the workshop, not to mention the additional sessions. So no, there is no refund policy, but I'm there to help and support the participants. The primary approach is if you do not sign up for office hours, it is through Discord. If you do sign up for office hours or one-on-one coaching or the cohort experience, then of course there's a more personalized experience because we can meet face-to-face, at least via video. So that’s definitely a stronger engagement. [* ](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s)

Having a supportive community and being responsive can really enhance the experience. The demo vault sounds like an incredible resource too—it's great that you've put so much effort into providing valuable materials. Are there any specific outcomes or transformations you hope participants will achieve by the end of the course? My primary hope is that when you read something or when you process some information, you immediately start to think about how you would visualize this. Visualizing and creating good concept visuals is difficult, but it's difficult not because it's hard to draw. Yes, some people are not good at drawing, but frankly, I'm a terrible drawer, so I'm using—if you look at all my illustrations, I'm using readymade icons. I'm also sharing some "cheating" approaches of what I do to create illustrations that are personal and look like something I created, but really I'm using a mouse on the computer. I have a drawing tablet, but I use it very rarely because I'm really not good with pen and pencil. I'm good at a computer. Where I wanted to go with this idea is that the reason illustration is hard is that you're trying to convert something abstract into something concrete. Research has shown that we remember the concrete much better than the abstract. For example, a word like "house" or "horse" will be remembered much better than something like "freedom" or "love" because those are abstract concepts. Forcing yourself to create concept visuals encourages you to think in concrete terms, which will improve your retention and understanding of the information. So my hope is that people develop this skill of thinking in concrete terms, putting it on virtual paper, and also creating this feedback loop that Annie Murphy Paul talks about in the book—where you can look at what you thought, and then you can think about it and look at it again. [* ](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s)

That’s a powerful goal—encouraging participants to visualize information can really deepen their understanding and retention. It's interesting how you emphasize using icons and digital tools, showing that drawing skills aren't necessary to create meaningful visuals. Have you noticed any specific challenges that people face when they start trying to visualize their thoughts? I've noticed two challenges: one, many people put it off in the cohort-based approach until cohort session three or four before they finally start to create illustrations. You know, it is a trial-and-error thing; you should start creating illustrations immediately, and then you'll get good at it. You'll learn some of the basics and you'll find out that it is really super simple. The other is, I think the seven-step concept visuals—the process that we discuss in the workshop in terms of how you can create meaningful concept visuals—is an eye-opener for many. I remember our session on practicing stoicism with the team, and I don't exactly remember the quote—I think it was from Seneca—and it was something about "good or too much good will spoil the good." The illustration we came up with in the end was a very nice illustration of a steak with too much salt on it. You know, the illustration is simple; we looked up an icon for steak and a salt shaker, and then we wrote two or three words under it about the oversalty steak. I remember the steak to this day, and through that, I remember the Seneca quote, and through that, I remember the entire event. I see this as a repeated "aha" moment for participants as we go through the process, and it turns out that a seemingly impossible quote can turn into a very nice concrete simple illustration in the process of a 20-30 minute discussion. Of course, as you develop this practice, it speeds up, but it's not instantaneous—or at least for me it is not yet. It is always a mental challenge to come up with a good illustration because, as I said earlier, I'm translating the abstract into the concrete, and that is hard. Usually, we skip that—we sort of say big words and we think we know what it means, but in reality, we don't know. [* ](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s)

That reminds me of one thing. I was reading a story. It sounds like you've identified some key hurdles in the learning process. It's interesting how participants often wait to start creating illustrations, but once they do, it becomes an eye-opening experience for them. The example of the steak and salt shaker is a great illustration of how a simple visual can help anchor a complex idea in memory. The challenge of translating abstract concepts into concrete visuals really highlights the depth of understanding required. It’s not just about creating pretty pictures; it’s about engaging with the material on a deeper level. I'm curious to hear the story you were reading. What was it about? Yes, so it was about Charles Darwin—the name escaped me for whatever reason. It was about Darwin, and I remember in school he grew up observing animals, and he was asked if he knew the names of the animals. It turned out that he didn’t know the names of the animals, but he knew everything about them. I think this is how we often are with verbs; we use big abstract terms, but we never really take the effort to understand what they mean. We throw around big words; we talk about big ideas, but without translating them into something visual, we really stay on the surface of the idea. We never dig deep to understand what the message is we’re trying to tell and what are the concrete concepts or elements that we could use to convey that story. [* ](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s)

That’s a powerful story about Darwin! It really illustrates the idea that knowing the essence of something—like the behaviors and characteristics of animals—is far more valuable than just knowing their names. This parallels how many of us engage with abstract concepts without fully grasping their meanings. By visualizing ideas, we dig deeper and develop a better understanding. It forces us to break down those big words into tangible elements, which can enhance both comprehension and retention. It sounds like your workshop is fostering this kind of deep engagement with the material. Definitely! That is my drive—to create this deep engagement with the material. Another thought that regularly crosses my mind is that in today's world, everything nudges us to be superficial. If a video is not good or doesn't capture your interest or imagination, you'll switch to the next one in 10-15 seconds. I believe that great achievements require significant work. I don't believe in easy results. Look at anyone who has achieved a Nobel Laureate or anything significant in the world—they spent not hours, not days, not weeks, not months, but years or even decades on the topic. My point is that by creating illustrations and this visual feedback journey, I create an environment where people can dive deeper. [* ](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s)

You're encouraging participants to invest time and effort into understanding concepts fully rather than just skimming the surface. In a world where instant gratification is the norm, slowing down to truly engage with material can feel counterintuitive. By emphasizing that mastery requires dedication, you're not just teaching them to create visuals; you’re instilling a mindset of perseverance and depth. This kind of learning is invaluable and can lead to those "aha" moments that transform how they think and process information. What kind of feedback have you received from participants about this shift in approach? One of the feedbacks I've received is that typically, there's a hardcore of the cohort that takes the process until the end and creates the Book on a Page, telling the story. I’ve seen super satisfied, happy people who have gotten to this point—satisfied with the story they told and satisfied with the learning. I can also see some of the materials that they share from time to time in terms of creating their own Book on a Page visuals and just getting back with some ideas to our showcase, etc. I also see that many people don’t have the energy or the time to invest, and therefore they lose interest or step out of the process. My hope is that the self-paced course provides this opportunity, because the cohort is six or seven weeks long, and it requires really at least one day or more per week investment. I can fully understand that people struggle to set aside that much time in their busy agendas. I think with the self-paced course, you can still complete it in about 5 to 6 weeks if you're focused on it. But that's going to be hard work; remember there's 12 and a half hours of video, a book to read, and illustrations to do. This is a heavy course, but people who don't have that amount of time and maybe can do it in two or three months will still get the same level of engagement and value out of it—or maybe even more, because it's a longer brewing process. Usually, the long brew results in a better flavor, so I think that's my hope. [* ](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s)

Your experience and feedback reveal that many people have seen the amount of work and said, "No, I don't have the time," or "I'll listen to recordings," etc. The people who have completed the workshops, I can see very satisfied people using the tools and approaches in different contexts. Sometimes I come across those results, and that always makes me smile. It gives me warmth when I see their progress and how they've integrated what they've learned into their own work. It's rewarding to see that effort pay off in their visual creations and storytelling. You're right; the self-paced course offers flexibility for those who might struggle to commit to a structured timeline. The idea of a longer brewing process enhancing the learning experience makes sense too. It allows participants to digest the material at their own pace, which can lead to deeper understanding and retention. It's great that you're getting feedback on both sides—the dedicated individuals who complete the cohort and those who need more flexibility. Have you thought about ways to encourage those who might feel overwhelmed to engage more fully in the self-paced course? That's where the one-on-one coaching, office hours, and the Discord community come in, as well as the exercises and the help I provide in the self-paced course. The self-paced course assumes that you have no experience with Obsidian and Excalidraw. It is not a tools course, so I'm not teaching how to use the tools, but I'm teaching the methodology and workflow. However, along the way, we start with setting up Obsidian from zero, learning the basics of Obsidian, then installing the required plugins and learning the basics of Excalidraw. Gradually, I add additional bits and pieces, so I think some of the people who are not so tech-savvy will find this a much more engaging approach. 

However, I think we need to bring the conversation to an end. Help me conclude this discussion by providing a summary of the key points that you learned from this. Let me know if there's any further last question or skeptical issue that you would like me to answer. It sounds like you have a well-structured approach in your self-paced course that balances teaching the methodology with gradually introducing the tools. This can really help participants feel more confident and engaged, especially those who might be less tech-savvy. To summarize the key points from our discussion, you emphasize the importance of visualizing concepts to enhance understanding and retention of information. Many participants in your cohort-based workshops often delay creating illustrations, but you encourage starting early to build skills through trial and error. The seven-step concept visuals process has proven to be an eye-opener for participants, turning abstract ideas into concrete visuals. You're aiming to deepen engagement with material, recognizing that great achievements require significant effort over time. Your self-paced course provides flexibility for learners, allowing them to engage with the material at their own pace while still offering support through coaching, office hours, and a community.

As for final thoughts, I appreciate how you're combining structured learning with flexibility; it seems like a great way to foster deeper engagement and understanding. Is there anything specific you would like to focus on in the future to enhance the learning experience for your participants? I'm going to use Cohort 11, as I mentioned—it's a special cohort because we're going through "The Extended Mind," which is part of the self-paced course as well. I'm going to use that feedback and place it into the course. Any immediate feedback I receive, I'm also planning to start an ongoing community—I call it the Technovisual PKM Community—that's going to be a paid community where we continue to talk about these topics. Of course, I continue to work and develop on Excalidraw and Excalibrain. I still have lots of ideas on how to improve that tool; it is really the core element of my own personal workflow. I have moved from a text-based PKM to, I would say, a 90% visual PKM. I rarely touch markdown documents that are just documents. Of course, I flip the drawings over, and I write on the backside of the note, but other than that, everything I do—including my daily notes, my book pages, and my map of contents—is really hard to mention anything that is not visual in my PKM. As we progress, that's definitely one thing I'm going to be doing. Finally, I have some discussions with some cohort alumni who approached me, and we are thinking of starting a visual thinking mini-workshop approach. You can sign up and learn a specific visual thinking tool through a practical example in a 4-hour workshop setting. That's something I hope to work on with this individual over the next couple of months and hopefully launch it maybe early next year as an additional visual thinking approach. This is not going to be a Book on a Page, but it's going to be about different visual thinking tools—different collaborative visual thinking tools that you can also use at work with your colleagues, etc. [* ](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s)

[self-based course this course contains](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=14) [12 and a half hours of handson video I'm](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=17) [taking you through the study of the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=22) [extended Mind by Annie Murphy Paul a](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=24) [book that is super relevant to the topic](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=27) [of spatial visual thinking and of course](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=30) [the course includes my demo Vault with](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=34) [six Book on a page examples complete](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=36) [with literature notes and everything and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=39) [whole lot more on top of this I'm adding](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=43) [couple of offers if you want to have a](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=46) [more deep learning experience I'm adding](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=49) [office hours one-on-one coaching and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=52) [I'll still keep the cohort](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=55) [experience indeed as part of this launch](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=58) [I'm hosting a special cohort cohort 11](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=62) [which is going to take you through the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=65) [extended mind alongside the self-based](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=68) [course I thought I would make this](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=71) [launch a bit playful so I invited Chad](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=73) [GPT to interview me about the course and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=78) [ask me a couple of challenging questions](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=81) [let me know how you like this approach](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=84) [so let's play a game I'm launching the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=87) [visual thinking Workshop self-based](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=89) [course this week first ask me a couple](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=91) [of questions about the workshop and then](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=94) [ask me some challenging more skeptical](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=96) [questions that come to mind as them one](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=99) [by one make this into a dialogue sure](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=102) [let's get started first can you tell me](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=105) [what the main goal of the visual](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=108) [thinking Workshop is what can](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=109) [participants expect to gain from it so](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=111) [from a practical perspective the main](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=113) [goal of the workshop is to take you](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=116) [through the process of reading a book](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=118) [creating a book on a page summary and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=121) [then adding visual zle cting or](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=123) [permanent notes to your knowledge](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=127) [management system at a more broad](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=128) [perspective the objective of the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=132) [workshop is to use this book on a page](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=135) [approach to help you build some visual](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=137) [thinking skills including illustration](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=140) [skills including linking and thinking](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=143) [skills and storytelling skills as well](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=146) [that's sounds interesting so how do you](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=149) [ensure that participants actually apply](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=151) [what they learn are there any specific](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=153) [exercises or activities built into the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=156) [course to encourage that yeah so the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=158) [course takes you through the extended](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=161) [Mind by Annie Murphy Paul and I think by](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=163) [the way the book is super relevant to](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=167) [the topic of thinking spatially and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=169) [using visuals as an external extension](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=172) [of our thinking and throughout the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=176) [course I'm working with you the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=179) [participant so we are we are going](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=181) [through the book I am also creating](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=184) [illustrations showing you different](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=187) [approaches I'm also crafting my](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=189) [storyline and along the journey there](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=192) [are 49 lessons in total and there are](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=194) [almost 40 different exercises so almost](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=198) [every lesson completes with a practical](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=201) [exercise that you need to do based on](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=204) [what we discussed in the lesson](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=207) [and based on of course your reading](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=210) [experience of the extended mind that's](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=212) [great to hear but I have to ask what](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=215) [makes your different from other visual](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=218) [thinking courses out there why should](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=221) [someone choose this one over the many](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=223) [others available frankly I don't think](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=225) [that there are many others available yes](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=228) [there are illustration courses and yes](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=230) [there are PKM courses like building a](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=233) [second brain or linking your thinking by](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=236) [Nick Milo but there are no courses that](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=238) [I know of that are visual thinking](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=242) [courses in the sense of personal](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=245) [Knowledge Management I take you through](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=248) [a process of how you can work with](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=250) [visuals similar to text meaning you can](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=253) [link them you can reference them you can](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=256) [deconstruct them into smaller pieces and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=261) [reference them that way it is a full](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=264) [methodology ology and the workflow for](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=269) [creating a 100% visual personal](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=272) [Knowledge Management System their text](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=275) [is still present of course I don't think](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=278) [text I I am not against text in fact I](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=280) [think that a picture speaks a thousand](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=284) [words only if you think or say those](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=286) [words so words are super important but I](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=290) [think my course is 100% unique there's](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=294) [nothing like it in terms of of](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=297) [connecting your visual ideas and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=300) [creating a four](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=302) [dimensional interactive Knowledge](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=305) [Management](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=307) [System centered around visuals that](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=309) [sounds interesting but how can I be sure](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=312) [that this course will actually help me](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=315) [improve my visual thinking skills what](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=316) [kind of results can I realistically](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=319) [expect after completing it I have two](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=321) [parts to my answer here part one is I](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=324) [think if you think about your education](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=327) [your upbringing then the school system](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=331) [at least the one I went to prioritized](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=334) [writing and reading over illustrations](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=337) [and visual thinking in fact we had art](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=341) [class and that was it and everything](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=343) [else was about reading and writing so in](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=346) [my view then if you think](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=350) [again what did you do first did you draw](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=354) [first when you were a child or did you](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=357) [write first and of course the answer is](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=359) [you drew first so then there's a](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=362) [question of nature versus nurture what](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=364) [will be nurtured to work on and my](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=368) [argument is if you invest more time into](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=372) [writing courses you're going to improve](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=376) [of course but it's going to be a small](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=379) [Improvement if you invest in visual](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=382) [thinking courses then because they have](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=385) [not had the nurturing throughout our](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=388) [schooling I think there is going to be a](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=391) [step change that you can achieve and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=394) [what I can promise you is you'll have a](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=398) [completely different thinking about how](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=400) [illustrations work you will stop](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=403) [thinking about them as something you](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=406) [place in the sources or resources folder](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=408) [and you just have images that are sort](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=411) [of resources to images becoming the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=414) [actual ideas or the representation of](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=418) [ideas maybe just one more thought here](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=422) [that I heard this thought from Elon Musk](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=425) [when he was talking about neurolink and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=429) [talking about the effective bit rate and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=431) [he mentioned that of course the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=434) [effective bit rate of language is](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=436) [extremely slow and I argue that the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=440) [effective bit rate or let's say the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=443) [compression that you can achieve with](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=446) [visuals is much higher does if you do](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=448) [visuals well then it will Elevate the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=451) [depth of your thinking because you're](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=456) [going to be able to work with larger](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=458) [Concepts quicker and I think of course I](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=461) [cannot promise that by the end of the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=465) [course you achieve all of these but I'm](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=467) [I can definitely promise that by the end](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=471) [of the course you are going to be](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=473) [thinking differently about illustrations](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=475) [and about their role in your Knowledge](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=478) [Management note taking system that makes](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=480) [sense but I still have concerns about](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=483) [the practical application how can I](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=485) [integrate what I learn in this course](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=487) [into my existing Knowledge Management](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=490) [System will it work with tools I'm](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=492) [already using or will I have to change](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=493) [my entire setup so the tool or the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=496) [course does use obsidian and obsidian](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=499) [exol draw and exol brain as the base](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=503) [tools and it is true that I've searched](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=506) [for many years I would say for 25 years](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=510) [I've been searching for a visual](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=513) [thinking tool I tried lots of tools like](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=515) [mind mapping tools or like different](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=518) [drawing tools and things like one note](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=521) [Etc but frankly I didn't find the tool](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=525) [I'm looking for and that's why I created](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=529) [the obsidian exol drop plugin so yes](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=532) [some of the concepts that I explain are](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=535) [obsidian EX po it](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=538) [specific however I also believe that the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=540) [basic mindset of thinking visually and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=544) [the use of](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=547) [visuals is tool agnostic and I would say](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=548) [that at least 80% of what the course is](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=553) [about can be applied to I think a broad](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=556) [range of Knowledge Management tools the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=560) [other thing I would highlight is that](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=563) [the course is not only applicable to](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=566) [uh personal Knowledge Management I think](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=570) [or I believe that thinking is](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=573) [communication it is communicating our](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=576) [ideas with others or with ourselves to](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=579) [create feedback loops as an pole says](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=582) [they are loopy creatures and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=586) [illustrations creating drawings is an](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=589) [important feedback loop so I think this](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=592) [skill of thinking visually will](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=596) [influence how you work how do how you do](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=600) [other parts of your life and the other](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=603) [aspect here is visual storytelling and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=606) [just think of a presentation you do at](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=608) [work it is visual storytelling your](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=611) [slide is the card the card forcing](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=614) [function if you look at the mindset](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=617) [framework that I'm teaching and you need](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=619) [to tell a story and I believe that the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=622) [same approaches the same Concepts about](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=626) [storytelling about illustration design](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=629) [about creating meaningful concept](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=632) [visuals that are not trivial icons but](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=635) [actually convey the message you want to](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=640) [say I believe that that is 100% relevant](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=642) [to professional presentations as well](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=647) [not just in excolo and obsidian but in](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=649) [tools like for example PowerPoint or](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=653) [Google Slides or keynote they are all](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=655) [tools where you can Implement similar](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=658) [approaches that's reassuring to hear but](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=662) [I'm still wondering about the long-term](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=664) [benefits how do I know that the skills I](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=666) [learn in this Workshop will stick with](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=668) [me after the course is](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=670) [over what kind of support do you offer](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=672) [after I complete the course to help](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=674) [reinforce what I've learned there's](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=676) [going to be a community a Discord](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=678) [Community anyone signing up for the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=680) [course will automatically become part of](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=683) [that community so one of my approaches](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=686) [is to have that community in place the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=689) [second approach is I see the visual](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=692) [thinking Workshop self-based course as](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=696) [an](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=699) [entry course if you would say and I will](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=700) [continue to have cohort-based courses](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=704) [but the cohort-based](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=707) [course is going to focus on the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=709) [practical application of these](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=712) [approaches so instead of teaching the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=715) [basics we are going to take take a book](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=717) [it's going to be like a visual book club](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=719) [and from book to book we are going to be](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=722) [going through the process of creating](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=726) [illustrations creating](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=729) [stories uh creating permanent notes and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=732) [going through all the practices concept](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=736) [Maps mind maps research around it that](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=738) [sounds promising but what if I struggle](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=741) [with some of the concepts during the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=744) [self-paced course is there a way to get](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=745) [help or ask questions if I'm having](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=748) [difficulty the self-paced course is](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=750) [going to come with couple of additional](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=753) [options or offers one of them is to sign](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=755) [up for two month of office hours office](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=759) [hours are going to happen every second](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=763) [week and there's going to be an hour](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=765) [where those people who are at that time](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=768) [subscribed to office hours can come and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=772) [ask questions and it's going to be an](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=775) [interactive session with me by the way](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=777) [I'm going to have one for the East time](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=779) [zone so Asia and one for the Americas](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=783) [and Europe and it's going to be an](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=785) [alternating week so if someone joins](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=787) [from the East time zone then they are](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=790) [going to have an opportunity to have a](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=793) [dialogue with me as well so that's one](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=797) [of the options that I'm adding to the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=799) [workshop the other option I'm adding is](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=801) [a one-on-one coaching option that people](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=805) [people can subscribe to and if they do](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=809) [then with that they are going to have an](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=812) [option of setting up a 1 hour slot with](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=815) [me and we can dive into his or her](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=818) [immediate issues and questions and on](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=823) [top of all of this as I'm launching the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=826) [course I'm going to run cohort 11 as a](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=828) [unique and special cohort in cohort 11](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=832) [we're going to be reading the extend](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=836) [mind so we are going to work through the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=839) [self-based course together this is an](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=841) [awesome opportunity I think in terms of](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=845) [having the self-based course at hand but](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=849) [also having these cohort-based sessions](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=851) [where we actually practice the material](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=855) [in the book and I'm also super excited](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=859) [because I want to read the extended mind](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=862) [again so it's a good book I want to go](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=865) [through it with a cohort and have those](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=867) [discussions so I think that's going to](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=870) [be a special opportunity now as I'm](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=873) [launching the course but later on as](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=876) [well I'm offering a cohort option next](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=879) [to the course so people who take the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=882) [self-based course can opt in or buy an](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=885) [option to participate at a future cohort](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=888) [and use that as an opportunity to deepen](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=892) [their](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=896) [understanding that sounds like a a great](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=897) [support system but what if someone feels](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=899) [that the content isn't meeting their](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=901) [expectations or needs do you have a](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=903) [refund policy or any way for](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=906) [participants to voice their concerns](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=908) [about the course so I'm definitely there](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=909) [to listen absolutely and Discord is one](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=912) [way of contacting me I think those who](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=915) [have worked with me know that I am super](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=918) [responsive to anyone's issues and I try](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=921) [to do everything in my power to help you](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=925) [even those who are not participating

absolutely](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=943) [open to sharing there is no refund](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=947) [policy however because when you purchase](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=950) [the course you essentially purchase my](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=953) [intellectual property this is why I sort](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=956) [of split this offer into separate parts](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=959) [so you can purchase the course with the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=962) [demo Vault we haven't yet talked about](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=964) [the demo volt the demo volt is a super](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=966) [important part of the entire package in](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=970) [the demo volt you get seven Book on a](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=973) [page examples complete with full](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=976) [literature notes with everything with](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=979) [book on a pages with icons you get](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=981) [almost 7 7 400 icons you also get a an](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=984) [article on a page some zle Casten notes](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=990) [you get my mindset cards uh all of them](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=993) [or 35 of them with lots of background](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=997) [information so with the demo Vault you](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1001) [also get my templator scripts you you](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1004) [get a huge value with the demo Vault](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1008) [itself many of the participants earlier](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1011) [have commented that the demo VA itself](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1014) [was worth the price of the workshop not](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1017) [to mention the additional sessions so no](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1020) [there is no refund policy but I'm there](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1024) [to help and there to uh support the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1027) [participants and the primary approach if](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1031) [you do not sign up for office hours is](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1034) [through Discord if you do sign up for](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1038) [office hours or one-on-one coaching or](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1040) [the cohort experience then of course](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1043) [there's a more personalized](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1045) [experience because then we can meet face](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1049) [to face at least via video so that's](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1051) [definitely a stronger](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1055) [engagement having a supportive community](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1058) [and being responsive can really enhance](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1061) [the experience the demo Vault sounds](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1063) [like an incredible resource too it's](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1065) [great that you've put so much effort](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1068) [into providing valuable materials are](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1069) [there any specific outcomes or](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1072) [Transformations you hope participants](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1073) [will achieve by the end of the course oh](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1075) [my primary hope is that when you read](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1078) [something or when you process some](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1082) [information you immediately start to](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1084) [think about how would I visualize this](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1087) [and you know visualizing creating good](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1090) [concept visuals is difficult but it's](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1093) [difficult not because it's hard to draw](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1096) [yes some people are not good at drawing](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1099) [but frankly I'm a terrible draw so I'm](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1103) [using if you look at all my illust](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1106) [ations I'm using readymade icons and I'm](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1109) [also sharing some cheating approaches of](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1112) [what I do to create illustrations that](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1115) [are personal that look like something I](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1118) [created but really I'm using a mouse on](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1121) [the computer I have a drawing tablet but](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1125) [I use it very rarely because I'm really](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1128) [not good with pen and pencil I'm good at](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1131) [a computer so the and where I wanted to](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1134) [go with this idea is the reason](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1139) [illustration is hard is because you're](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1142) [trying to convert something abstract](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1144) [into something concrete and you know](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1147) [research has shown that we remember the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1150) [concrete much better than the abstract](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1153) [so a word concrete like house or horse](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1155) [or whatever you will remember much](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1159) [better than something like Freedom or](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1162) [love because those are abstract Concepts](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1165) [and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1168) [forcing yourself to create concept](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1169) [visuals forces you to think in concrete](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1172) [terms which will improve your retention](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1176) [and understanding of information so my](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1179) [hope is that people develop this skill](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1182) [of thinking in concrete terms putting it](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1186) [on Virtual paper and also creating this](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1189) [feedback loop that Annie Murphy Paul](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1192) [talks about in the book that you can](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1195) [look at what you thought and then you](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1197) [can think about it and look at it again](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1199) [and through](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1202) [this Loop that's a powerful goal](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1203) [encouraging participants to visualize](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1207) [information can really deepen their](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1209) [understanding and retention it's](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1211) [interesting how you emphasize using](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1214) [icons and digital tools showing that](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1216) [drawing skills aren't necessary to](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1218) [create meaningful visuals have you](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1220) [noticed any specific challenges people](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1222) [face when they start trying to visualize](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1224) [their thoughts so I fa two challenges or](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1226) [I've noticed two things one many people](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1230) [put it off in the cohort based approach](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1234) [until cohort session three or four](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1237) [before they finally start to create](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1240) [illustrations and you know what it is a](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1242) [trial and error thing you should start](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1245) [creating illustrations immediately and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1247) [then you'll get good at it you'll learn](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1250) [some of the basics and you'll find out](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1253) [that it is really super simple](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1255) [the other is I think the seven step](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1259) [concept visuals the process that we](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1261) [discuss in the workshop in terms of how](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1264) [you can create meaningful concept](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1267) [visuals is an eyeopener for many I](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1270) [remember our session on the practicing](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1272) [stoic with the team and I don't exactly](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1275) [remember the quote I think it was from](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1278) [Sena and it was something about good or](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1281) [too much good it will spoil the good and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1284) [the illustration we came up with in the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1289) [end was a very nice illustration it was](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1291) [a steak with too much salt on it and you](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1294) [know the illustration is simple we](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1297) [looked up an icon for steak and for salt](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1299) [shaker and then we wrote two words under](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1302) [it or three about the overs salty steak](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1305) [and I remember the steak to this day and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1309) [through that I remember the Sena quote](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1313) [and through that I remember the entire](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1316) [event and I think I see this as a](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1319) [repeated aha moment for participants as](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1322) [we go through the process and it turns](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1325) [out that a seemingly impossible quote](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1328) [can turn into a very nice concrete](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1331) [simple illustration in the process of a](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1335) [20 30 minute discussion and of course as](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1338) [you develop practice with this this](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1341) [speeds up but it's not going to be](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1344) [instantaneous or at least for me it is](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1347) [not yet it is always a mental challenge](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1349) [to come up with a good illustration but](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1352) [I think it's a mental challenge as I](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1355) [said earlier because I'm translating the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1357) [abstract into the concrete and that is](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1360) [hard and usually we skip that we sort of](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1363) [say big words and we think we know what](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1366) [it means but re in reality we don't know](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1369) [that reminds me of one thing so I was](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1372) [reading this story it sounds like you've](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1374) [identif ified some key hurdles in the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1378) [learning process it's interesting how](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1380) [participants often wait to start](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1382) [creating illustrations but once they do](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1384) [it becomes an eye-opening experience for](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1387) [them the example of the steak and salt](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1389) [shaker is a great illustration of how a](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1391) [simple visual can help anchor a complex](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1394) [idea in memory the Challen of](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1396) [translating abstract Concepts into](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1399) [concrete visuals really highlights the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1401) [depth of understanding](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1403) [required it's not just about creating](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1405) [pretty pictures it's it's about engaging](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1407) [with the material on a deeper level I'm](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1409) [curious to hear the story you were](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1412) [reading what was it about yeah so it was](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1413) [about Charles Darwin the name escaped me](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1417) [for whatever reason so it was about](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1419) [Darvin and Darin remembering that in](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1422) [school uh so he grew up observing](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1425) [animals and in school he was asked what](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1429) [name if he knows the names of the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1434) [animals and it turned out that he did](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1436) [didn't know the names of the animals but](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1438) [he knew everything about them and I](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1440) [think this is how we are often with](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1442) [verbs we use big abstract terms but we](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1446) [never really take the effort to](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1450) [understand what they mean so we throw](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1453) [around big words we talk about Big Ideas](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1455) [but without translating it into](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1460) [something visual we really stay at the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1462) [surface of the idea we never dig deep to](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1465) [understand what is the message we are](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1468) [trying to tell and what are the concrete](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1471) [Concepts or](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1475) [concrete ideas elements that we could](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1476) [use to convey that story that's a](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1479) [powerful story about Darwin it really](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1482) [illustrates the idea that knowing the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1484) [essence of something like the behaviors](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1486) [and characteristics of animals is far](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1488) [more valuable than just knowing their](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1490) [names this parallels how many of us](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1492) [engage with abstract Concepts without](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1495) [fully Gra grasping their meanings by](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1497) [visualizing ideas we dig deeper and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1499) [develop a better understanding it forces](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1502) [us to break down those big words into](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1504) [tangible Elements which can enhance both](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1506) [comprehension and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1508) [retention it sounds like your Workshop](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1509) [is fostering this kind of deep](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1512) [engagement with material yeah definitely](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1513) [so that is my drive to create this deep](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1516) [engagement with material so another](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1519) [thought that regularly crosses my mind](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1522) [that in today's world everything nudges](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1526) [us to be superficial if a video is not](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1529) [good it doesn't capture your interest or](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1534) [your imagination you'll switch to the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1537) [next one in 10 15 seconds and I believe](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1539) [that great achievements require](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1544) [significant work I don't believe in Easy](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1547) [results and look at anyone who achieved](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1551) [a noble laurat or anything significant](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1554) [in the world they spent not hours not](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1558) [days not weeks not months on the topic](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1561) [but years or even decades so my point is](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1563) [by way of creating illustrations by way](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1568) [of creating this visual feedback journey](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1572) [I create this environment where people](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1576) [can encouraging participants to invest](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1580) [time and effort into understanding](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1582) [concepts fully rather than just skimming](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1584) [the surface it's true that in a world](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1586) [where instant gratification is the norm](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1589) [slowing down to truly engage with](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1591) [material can feel](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1593) [counterintuitive by emphasizing that](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1595) [Mastery requires dedication you're not](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1597) [just teaching them to create visuals](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1599) [you're instilling a mindset of](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1601) [perseverance and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1602) [depth this kind of learning is](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1604) [invaluable and can lead to those aha](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1606) [moments that transform how they think](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1608) [and process information what kind of](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1611) [feedback have you received from](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1613) [participants about this shift in](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1615) [approach so](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1616) [one of the feedbacks I've received is](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1618) [typically the there is a hardcore of the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1622) [cohort who takes the process until the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1626) [end and creates the process visual at](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1629) [the end not the process visual the book](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1631) [on a page and tells the story and I've](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1634) [seen super uh satisfied happy people who](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1637) [got to this point satisfied with the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1642) [story they told satisfied with the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1645) [learning and I can also see some of the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1647) [materials that they share from time to](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1650) [time in terms of creating their own book](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1652) [on a page visuals and just getting back](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1655) [with some ideas to our showcase Etc I](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1658) [also see that many people don't have the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1663) [energy or the time to invest and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1667) [therefore they along the way lose](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1671) [interest or step out of the process My](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1674) [Hope is that the self-paced course](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1677) [provides this opportunity that because](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1681) [the cohort is six or seven weeks long](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1683) [and it requires really at least one day](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1687) [or more per week investment and I can](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1690) [fully understand that people struggle to](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1693) [set aside that much time in their busy](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1696) [agendas I think with the self-paced](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1699) [course you can still complete the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1701) [self-based course in about 5 to 6 weeks](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1704) [if you're focused on it but that's going](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1707) [to be hard work remember there's 12 and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1709) [a half hours of video and there's a book](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1712) [to read and there are illustrations to](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1716) [do so this is a heavy piece of uh course](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1718) [but people who don't have that amount of](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1723) [time within five to six weeks maybe can](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1725) [do the course in two or three months and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1728) [they will get the same level of](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1731) [Engagement and value out of it or maybe](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1734) [even more because it's a longer Brewing](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1737) [process and usually the long Brew](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1739) [results in a better flavor so I think](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1742) [that is my hope that with having the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1746) [self-based approach to all of this](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1749) [people will have an opportunity to](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1753) [engage deeper and I'll have more people](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1755) [go through the entire Journey but yeah](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1757) [so that's my experience and feedback](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1760) [many people have seen the amount of work](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1763) [and said No at this time I don't have](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1766) [the time I'll listen to recordings Etc](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1768) [the people who have completed the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1772) [workshops I can see very satisfied](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1774) [people who use the tools and approaches](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1777) [in different contexts and sometimes I](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1781) [come across those results and that](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1785) [always makes my uh makes me smile and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1787) [I'm always](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1790) [heartfelt gives me warmth when I see](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1792) [that their progress and how they've](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1795) [integrated what they've learned into](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1798) [their own work it's rewarding to see](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1800) [that effort pay off in their visual](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1802) [creations and storytelling you're right](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1804) [that the self-paced course offers](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1807) [flexibility for those who might struggle](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1809) [to commit to a structured timeline the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1811) [idea of a longer Brewing process](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1814) [enhancing The Learning Experience makes](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1816) [sense too it allows participants to](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1817) [digest the material at their own pace](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1820) [which can lead to deeper understanding](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1822) [and retention it's great that you're](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1824) [getting feedback on both sides the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1826) [dedicated individuals who complete the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1829) [cohort and those who need more](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1831) [flexibility have you thought about ways](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1833) [to encourage those who might feel](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1836) [overwhelmed to engage more fully in the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1837) [self-paced course so that's where the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1840) [one-on-one coaching and office hours uh](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1842) [come in um and the Discord Community as](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1845) [well as the just the exercises and the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1850) [help I provide in the self-based course](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1854) [so the self based](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1857) [course sort of assumes that you have no](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1859) [experience with obsidian and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1862) [xitrol it is not a tools course so I'm](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1864) [not teaching how to use the tools but](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1868) [I'm teaching the methodology and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1871) [workflow however along the way we start](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1873) [with setting up obsidian from zero](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1877) [learning the basics of obsidian then](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1879) [installing the required plugins and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1882) [learning the basics of excr and as we go](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1885) [I gradually add additional bits and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1888) [pieces so I think some of the people who](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1891) [are not so technology savy will find](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1893) [this a much more engaging approach](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1897) [however I think we need to bring the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1901) [conversation to an end so help me](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1903) [conclude this discussion maybe provide a](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1905) [summary of the key points that you](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1909) [learned from this and let me know if](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1911) [there's any further last question or](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1913) [skeptical](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1917) [issue that you have that you would like](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1918) [me to uh](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1920) [answer it sounds like you have a well](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1922) [structured approach in your self-paced](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1924) [course that balances teaching the](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1926) [methodology with gradually introducing](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1928) [the tools this can really help](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1931) [participants feel more confident and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1933) [engaged especially those who might be](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1935) [less techsavvy to summarize the key](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1937) [points from our discussion you emphasize](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1939) [the import of visualizing Concepts to](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1942) [enhance understanding and retention of](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1945) [information](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1947) [many participants in your cohort-based](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1948) [workshops often delay creating](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1950) [illustrations but you encourage starting](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1952) [early to build skills through trial and](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1955) [error the seven-step concept visuals](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1957) [process has proven to be an eyeopener](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1960) [for participants turning abstract ideas](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1961) [into concrete visuals you're aiming to](https://youtu.be/c00nlv4M08s?t=1964) [deepen engagement with
