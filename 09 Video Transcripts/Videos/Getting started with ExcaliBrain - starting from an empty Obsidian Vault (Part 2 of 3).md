![Getting started with ExcaliBrain - starting from an empty Obsidian Vault (Part 2 of 3)](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU)

# Summary
In the second part of a three-part series on ExcaliBrain, the video covers configuring relationships and links within the tool, including adding new and embedded nodes. It emphasizes the importance of understanding ontology in organizing information effectively. By the end of the series, viewers will gain a solid grounding in customizing their visual PKM setup.

# Key Takeaways
- The video provides step-by-step guidance on configuring relationships and links in ExcaliBrain.
- Viewers learn how to define and style node types, such as supporting arguments and their relationships.
- Customizing settings for embedded nodes and adjusting navigation synchronization is covered extensively.

So welcome back; this is part two of the Excalibrain dialogue mapping case study. In today's video, we're going to look at further configuring the relationships and the links in our Excalibrain. We are also going to be adding some new nodes, and we're going to look at embedded nodes as well. So there's plenty to learn, and then there's going to be still a part 3 where we are going to look at some additional things like web links and just polishing the whole thing up. Hopefully, by the end of the third part, you will have a good hands-on understanding of how to configure Excalibrain. [* ](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=0)

So today, let's continue from where we left off. We have the remote work policy in the center, and we defined the ontology for these two positions, but at the moment, you don't yet see the position reflected on the links. So we're going to open plugin settings again, and this time I'm going to scroll down. Well, before we scroll down, what I want to show you is here at the top of the settings, you have this section about ontology. I also have a bit of a description here that tries to explain what an ontology is. But here, what I want to point out is we have the position; this is what we added in part one to our ontology. We have a position here as a next friend type, and then I'm going to scroll down all the way to styling, and I'm going to come to the link styles. Now, link styles work very similarly to how node styles work from the perspective of inheritance. We have a base link style, and then all of the different node types or link types that you have here are going to inherit this. You can see that we have lots of different types; many of these come pre-packaged with Excalibrain. So you might want to delete these later on. I want to set up Excalibrain such that in every case the ontology is visible on the link. So I'm going to change the base link style for now, and I'm going to scroll down here and I'm going to turn on this link here to show the label on the link, and otherwise, I think I'm going to leave it like this. If you want, you can make the text slightly smaller or bigger. I like this relative sizing; that's why it comes with the base setup, so I'm going to leave it like this. [* ](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=45)

Now, additionally, you might also want to display arrows. So here I'm going to say that I'm going to set the start arrowhead to be an arrow, and then when we close our settings here, so now we did all of this setting for the base style. I didn't do any settings for the position type of style; we will see a different case a bit later on where I'm going to do settings because when I close the settings, then you will see that now the arrow is pointing from here to here because it's pointing to the start. Arrows can be a bit confusing, so depending on how you think about arrows and what's pointing from where to where, that depends on your internal dialogue and logic. So you have a couple of things that you can do around arrows. First of all, the base setting—how Excalibrain comes—or Excalibrain comes is an inverse arrow direction, which means that if I turn this off, then automatically the arrows will change direction, and then it will point the other way. What's considered the start and then the end will be different, or if I want to keep the inverse logic, then I can come down here and instead of setting the start arrowhead to be an arrow, I can set the end arrowhead to be an arrow. When I do this, then you can see that the end result is the same. [* ](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=90)

So I have the remote work policy here; I have these arrows pointing to these two other nodes that divert position written on them. So now let's continue to build our graph, but I'm going to do one thing here. So I'm going to first of all click on yes to remote work, and here I'm going to turn on the embedded mode. When I turn on the embedded mode, I can actually close this window, so you will see here I have this button that synchronizes navigation between the leaf and the Excalibrain view. Then I turned on the embedded mode; then this connector got disconnected. If I now turn off embedded mode, you will see that the connection is on, and when I turn again to embedded mode, then the connection is disconnected. So I can close this. If you don't like this behavior, again in Excalibrain settings, you can scroll down all the way to behavior, and you can click here to synchronize navigation with that toggle. If you turn this off, then the two buttons will work independently from each other. Again, you can play with this a bit later on to see the effects. I can show you the effect. So right now, if I click on remote work policy, you can see nothing happens on the right-hand side. If I turn this button on, then when I click on remote work policy, that page on the left-hand side changes as well, but now I'm going to turn that off and I'm going to close this, and actually, I'm going to close this as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=135)

So now we have the note here in the center. You will also notice, maybe you will or maybe you're not, but I'm now going to highlight it too. You will notice that this now has a light background, and that is because by default, Excalibrain comes with the configuration that the style of the embedded node should follow the style of Excalidraw. Now we are in a light Excalidraw, and therefore this is going to be light as well. So if I switch here to— I turn Excalibrain off in a way, so I'm going to turn off view mode, then I can switch here to dark mode, and you will see that this turns dark. The colors in this case look ugly, so I don't recommend this. Now, if you don't like this, so if you would like to see dark colors here, this is an example, then you need to go to Excalidraw settings to do the changes. So I'm going to click plugin settings, and I'm going to make these changes. I need to click here on Excalidraw, and in the Excalidraw settings, I need to scroll down to the display section, and here at the top of the display section, you will see that markdown embeds to match Excalidraw theme. If I turn this off, then when I come back, you will see that now the document follows a dark theme. If you have Excalibrain running, then it might turn out that you need to close and open Excalibrain again for this change to take effect; that's normal. But just letting you know that that's something that can happen. [* ](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=180)

So now I'm going to again turn Excalibrain back on because you see now this is Excalidraw. So this is now Excalibrain not running; to turn Excalibrain back on, I need to open the command palette, and I just need to type in "brain normal." With this, Excalibrain will recognize that this document is already open, and it will turn to Excalibrain view mode. So let's continue editing our documents. So first of all, I want to define here the supporting argument as an ontology as well. So again I have two options; I can either right-click and click here add supporting argument to Excalibrain ontology, so that's a perfectly valid option. That's what we did in part one. This time around, I'm going to press Control or Command B, and I'm going to just type in "next," and here in the command palette, I can choose Excalibrain add data view field to ontology as next. And when I click that, then you will see in a second that Excalibrain will update, and you will see that the improved work-life balance moved from the bottom to the side, and also now "supporting argument" as an ontology is displayed on this link. [* ](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=253)

Now we are going to create improved work-life balance. The way to create the document is I'm going to hold down the shift key and click on the supporting argument, and I'm going to create a markdown document. So with this now, I have my markdown document right here, and this is going to be a document type argument. That's why here I have the argument tag at the top, and it contains a question. This is the question: how can remote work improve employee work-life balance? And to make this question again here right-hand side or next type of ontology, you already know the answer. So what do I need to do? Yes, you guessed it right; I need to right-click, and I need to add the question to Excalibrain ontology, and I'm going to add this as a next friend. Then Excalibrain will update, and we'll add this question to the right-hand side of my graph. [* ](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=307)

Let's just do a final setting in today's session. We're going to format the supporting ontology link because I think it would look nice if supporting arguments would be green and objecting arguments would be red. So how do I do that? I think you can also guess this by now; you need to open Excalibrain settings, and in Excalibrain settings, we're going to scroll down to the very bottom. Here we're going to select from the next relationships; we're going to select supporting argument. Yes. So here's next supporting argument, and what I want to change is I want to change the color of this line; I want this to be green. So a supporting argument should be green, and I actually wanted to make this a bit thicker, so I'm going to click this that I'm setting this property of the supporting argument link type different compared to the base link type, and I'm going to make this a three-thick. So you can see now I have a nice thick green arrow right there, and when I close settings, then you will see that here the remote work policy has this supporting argument with the work-life balance here, and we can stop right here. Next time we are going to continue by adding some evidences as well that are going to be some web links, and we'll see how you can embed links in here as well. Plus, we are going to do some further formatting and settings, and hopefully, by the end of that you will have a pretty comfortable understanding of how Excalibrain works with the basics, and then you can do your own settings as well. Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=390)

the](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=78) [top of the settings you have this](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=82) [section about ontology I also have a bit](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=84) [of a description here that tries to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=87) [explain what an ontology is but here](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=89) [what I want to point out is we have

come](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=111) [to the link Styles now link Styles work](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=114) [very similar to how node Styles work](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=118) [from the perspective of inheritance so](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=122) [we have a base link style and then all](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=125) [of the different node types or link](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=129) [types that you have here are going to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=132) [inherit this and you can see that we](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=136) [have lots of different types many of](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=138) [these come pre-packaged with x-coli](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=142) [brain so you might want to delete these](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=145) [later on I want to set up excally brains](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=149) [such that in every case the ontology is](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=153) [visible on the link so I'm going to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=157) [change the base link style for now and](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=159) [I'm going to just scroll down here and](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=162) [I'm going to turn on this link here to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=166) [show label on link and otherwise I think](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=170) [I'm going to leave it like this if you](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=174) [want you can make the text slightly](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=177) [smaller or bigger](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=180) [I like this relative sizing that's why](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=181) [it comes with the base setup so I'm](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=185) [going to leave it like this](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=187) [now Additionally you might also want to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=190) [display arrows so here I'm going to say](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=193) [that I'm going to set the start](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=197) [Arrowhead to be an arrow and then when](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=201) [we close our settings here so now we did](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=205) [all of this setting for the base style I](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=209) [didn't do any settings for the position](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=212) [type of style we will see a different](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=215) [case a bit later on where I'm going to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=218) [do settings because when I close](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=221) [settings then you will see that now the](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=223) [arrow is pointing from here to here](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=227) [because at this pointing to the start](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=231) [arrows can be a bit confusing so](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=235) [depending on how you think about arrows](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=239) [and what's pointing from where to where](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=241) [um that that depends on your internal](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=246) [dialogue and logic so you have couple of](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=249) [things that you can do around arrows so](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=252) [first of all](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=255) [the bass setting how Excalibur comes or](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=256) [X holy brain comes is an inverse Arrow](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=260) [Direction which means that if I turn](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=264) [this off then automatically the arrows](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=268) [will change direction and then it will](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=272) [point the other way what's considered](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=274) [the start and then end will be different](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=278) [or if I want to keep the inverse logic](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=280) [then I can come down here and instead of](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=285) [setting the start Arrow Head To Be an](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=289) [Arrow I can set the end Arrowhead to be](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=292) [an arrow and when I do this then you can](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=296) [see that the end result is the same so I](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=298) [have the remote work policy here I have](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=301) [these arrows pointing to these two other](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=305) [nodes that diverts position written on](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=309) [them](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=312) [so now let's continue to build our graph](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=313) [but I'm going to do one thing here so](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=318) [I'm going to first of all click on yes](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=321) [to remote work and here I'm going to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=323) [turn on the embedded mode when I turn on](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=327) [the embedded mode I can actually close](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=332) [this window so you will see here I have](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=335) [this button that synchronizes navigation](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=338) [between the leaf and the excalibrain](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=342) [view then I turned on the embedded mode](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=347) [then this connector got disconnected so](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=351) [if I now turn off embedded mode you will](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=355) [see that the connection is on and when I](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=358) [turn again to embedded mode then the](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=362) [connection is disconnected so I can](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=365) [close this if you don't like this](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=368) [Behavior again in excali brain settings](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=370) [you can scroll down all the way to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=373) [behavior and you can click here to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=377) [synchronize navigation](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=380) [with the in that toggle if you turn this](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=383) [off then the two buttons will work](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=386) [independently from each other again you](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=389) [can play with this a bit later on to see](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=392) [the effects I can show you the effect so](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=394) [right now if I click on remote work](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=397) [policy you can see nothing happens on](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=400) [the right hand side if I turn this](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=403) [button on then when I click on remote](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=405) [for policy then that page on the left](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=407) [hand side changes as well but now I'm](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=411) [going to turn that off I'm going to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=414) [close this and actually I'm going to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=416) [close this as well so now we have the](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=419) [note here in the center you will also](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=423) [notice maybe you will maybe you're not](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=426) [but I'm now going to highlight it too so](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=428) [you will notice that this now has a](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=431) [light background and that is because by](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=435) [default X call it raw comes with the](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=439) [configuration that the style of the](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=443) [embedded node should follow the style of](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=447) [X color draw and now we are in a light](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=452) [excalator drawing and therefore this is](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=455) [going to be light as well so if I switch](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=459) [here to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=462) [I turn X holy brain off in a way so I'm](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=463) [going to turn off View mode then I can](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=467) [switch here to dark mode and you will](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=471) [see that this turns dark the colors in](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=474) [this case look ugly so I don't recommend](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=477) [this now if you don't like this so if](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=480) [you would like to see dark colors here](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=483) [this is an example then you need to go](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=485) [to xcolid Raw settings to do the changes](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=489) [so I'm going to click plugin settings](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=493) [and I'm going to make these changes I](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=496) [need to click here on xcolor draw and](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=499) [the next color draw settings I need to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=503) [scroll down to the display section and](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=505) [here at the top of the display section](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=509) [you will see that markdown embeds to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=511) [match excali draw theme if I turn this](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=514) [off](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=517) [then when I come back you will see that](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=518) [now the document follows a dark theme](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=522) [if you have excally brain running then](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=527) [it might turn out that you need to close](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=530) [and open exhale brain again for this](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=533) [change to take effect that's normal but](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=536) [just letting you know that that's](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=539) [something that can happen so now I'm](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=541) [going to again turn ex-coli brain back](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=543) [on because you see now this is X call it](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=546) [raw so this is now X call the brain is](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=549) [not running to turn X holy brain back on](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=551) [I need to open the command palette and I](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=554) [just need to type in brain normal with](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=557) [this ex call the brain will recognize](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=560) [that this document is already open and](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=564) [it will turn to excalibrane view mode so](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=567) [let's continue editing our documents so](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=571) [first of all I want to Define here the](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=574) [supporting argument as an ontology as](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=579) [well so again I have two options I can](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=583) [either right click and click here add](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=586) [supporting argument to excolibrant](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=589) [ontology so that's a perfectly valid](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=592) [option that's what we did in part one](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=595) [this time around I'm going to press](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=597) [control or command B and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=600) [just type in](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=603) [next and here in the common palette I](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=605) [can choose X call it brain add data view](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=610) [field to ontology as next and when I](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=613) [click that then you will see in a second](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=616) [that excalibrane will update and you](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=619) [will see that improves work-life balance](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=623) [moved from the bottom to the side and](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=626) [also now supporting argument as an](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=629) [oncology is displayed on this link](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=632) [now we are going to create improved](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=635) [work-life balance the way to create the](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=638) [document is I'm going to hold down the](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=640) [shift key and click on the supporting](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=643) [argument and I'm going to create a](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=646) [markdown document so with this now I](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=650) [have my markdown document right here and](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=653) [this is going to be a document type](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=657) [argument so that's why here I have the](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=660) [argument tag at the top and it contains](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=664) [a question and this is the question how](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=668) [can remote work improve employee work](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=672) [life balance and to make this question](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=675) [again here right hand side or next type](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=679) [of ontology you already know the answer](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=682) [so what do I need to do](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=685) [yes you guessed it right I need to right](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=687) [click and I need to add question to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=690) [excolibrian ontology and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=693) [add this as a next friend and then ex](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=696) [call your brain will update and we'll](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=701) [add this question to the right hand side](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=703) [of my graph](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=707) [let's just do a final setting in today's](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=709) [session we're going to format the](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=713) [supporting ontology link because I think](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=716) [it would look nice if supporting](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=720) [arguments would be green and objecting](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=722) [arguments would be red so how do I do](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=726) [that](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=730) [think you can also guess this by now you](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=731) [need to open x-coli Brain settings and](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=736) [in excali brain settings we're going to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=738) [scroll down to the very bottom and here](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=741) [we're going to select from the next](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=744) [relationships we're going to select](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=749) [supporting argument yes so here's next](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=752) [supporting argument on the supporting](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=756) [argument what I want to change is I want](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=759) [to change the color of this line I want](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=763) [this to be](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=767) [green so a supporting argument should be](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=769) [queen and I actually wanted to make this](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=773) [a bit thicker so I'm going to click this](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=776) [that I'm](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=780) [setting this property of the supporting](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=781) [argument link type different compared to](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=785) [the base link type and I'm going to make](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=788) [this a three thick so you can see now I](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=791) [have a nice thick Green Arrow right](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=795) [there and when I close settings then you](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=798) [will see that here the remote work](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=802) [policy has this supporting argument with](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=805) [the work life balance here and we can](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=809) [stop right here next time we are going](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=813) [to continue by adding some evidences as](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=815) [well that are going to be some web links](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=819) [and we'll see how you can embed links in](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=822) [here as well plus we are going to do](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=825) [some further formatting and settings](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=828) [and hopefully by the end of that you](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=832) [will have a pretty comfortable](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=835) [understanding of how X color brain works](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=837) [with the basics and then you can do your](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=840) [own settings as well](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=843) [thank you](https://youtu.be/JjyEicYtVcU?t=845)
