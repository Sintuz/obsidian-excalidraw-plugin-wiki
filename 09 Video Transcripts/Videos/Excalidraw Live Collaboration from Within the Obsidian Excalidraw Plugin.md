![Excalidraw Live Collaboration from Within the Obsidian Excalidraw Plugin](https://youtu.be/7isRfeAhEH4)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt demonstrates a new collaboration feature for Excalidraw within the Obsidian environment, allowing users to collaborate in real-time on drawings. He provides a step-by-step guide on how to install the Excalidraw collaboration script and how to use it for joint drawing and note-taking. Zsolt highlights the benefits of this integration, emphasizing the ease of use and ongoing access to collaborative work.

# Key Takeaways
- Excalidraw now supports live collaboration within Obsidian through a dedicated script.
- Users can create and share a collaboration frame that allows multiple participants to draw and take notes simultaneously.
- The collaborative drawings and notes are stored in the Excalidraw cloud, ensuring they can be accessed later as long as the user is online.

Hey everyone, Jolt here. [* ](https://youtu.be/7isRfeAhEH4?t=0)

One super feature in Excalidraw that was missing from Obsidian Excalidraw is live collaboration. I've just posted a script to the Excalidraw script library that provides a workaround. Let me show you. [* ](https://youtu.be/7isRfeAhEH4?t=3)

To get started, you first need to install the Excalibra collaboration script from the script library. This is extremely simple; you just click on the Obsidian icon, then you click on the script library button. The script library opens, and you need to scroll down to find the Excal collaboration frame script. You click on this and then click install. When you do this, you get a message that the script was installed. [* ](https://youtu.be/7isRfeAhEH4?t=9)

To run the script, you need to scroll down in the tools panel; this new icon will appear, which is the icon for the collaboration frame. When I press the button, a new collaboration frame appears, and I get a message that the link to this frame was copied to the clipboard. [* ](https://youtu.be/7isRfeAhEH4?t=24)

So, I'm going to move this frame here to the left and bring in a browser window. I'm going to enter the collaboration room by pasting the link from the clipboard. When I hit enter, I enter the same collaboration space, and you can see that my pointer appeared. You can also see that there are two people in this room. If I draw something here, that will appear right there. Similarly, if I draw something here, I need to activate the frame, and when I draw something here, the same drawing will appear in the browser window as well. This way, you can collaborate with colleagues and friends, having the drawing in your Excalidraw that is in Obsidian. [* ](https://youtu.be/7isRfeAhEH4?t=60)

What you can do is take notes around this; you can simply write whatever notes these are. Let's just say these are my notes about the meeting. You can also include Obsidian links and whatever, and in this way, you have your collaboration space. Whenever you open this page again, it will take you to this collaboration space. [* ](https://youtu.be/7isRfeAhEH4?t=127)

Excalidraw saves your collaboration work, and you can go back to it in the future. My understanding is this is never deleted; it's encrypted and stored in the Excalidraw cloud. Whenever you open Obsidian, this is going to be there. Of course, you need to be online; otherwise, this frame will not show the collaboration content. [* ](https://youtu.be/7isRfeAhEH4?t=155)

But I think this is a pretty nice integration of collaboration into Obsidian, a way that you can also add your special notes around the meeting, and you can add links to your vault. You can also collaborate with friends and colleagues in this window within Excalidraw. [* ](https://youtu.be/7isRfeAhEH4?t=189)

So, I hope you find this useful. Download the script, play with it, and enjoy Excalidraw. Thank you! [* ](https://youtu.be/7isRfeAhEH4?t=213)
