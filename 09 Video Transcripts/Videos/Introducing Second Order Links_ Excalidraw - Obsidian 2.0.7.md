![Introducing Second Order Links: Excalidraw - Obsidian 2.0.7](https://youtu.be/O_1ls9c6wBY)

# Summary
In this video, the presenter introduces a useful feature in Obsidian 2.0.7 that employs Excalidraw to enhance visual personal knowledge management (PKM). By clicking on an image, users can now access all instances where that icon is utilized, allowing for a more efficient connection of ideas. This functionality significantly improves workflow by enabling users to navigate directly to related content.

# Key Takeaways
- The introduction of second order links in Obsidian 2.0.7 using Excalidraw provides a new way to visualize connections between ideas.
- Clicking on an icon allows users to see all locations where the icon is used, streamlining the process of finding related content.
- This feature enhances the overall experience of visual PKM by making it easier to navigate and connect information.

I'm introducing a super useful small feature in Excalidraw - Obsidian 2.0.7. [* ](https://youtu.be/O_1ls9c6wBY?t=0) If you click on an image, you're not only going to get the first order link, which is the image itself, you can see here the icon, but I'm going to list all the places where this icon is used. [* ](https://youtu.be/O_1ls9c6wBY?t=6) This is super valuable because I use icons to connect ideas. [* ](https://youtu.be/O_1ls9c6wBY?t=21) For example, here, if I click on "checklist best practice," then immediately the image that contains the same icon is opened. [* ](https://youtu.be/O_1ls9c6wBY?t=27) I did not need to open the image first to hop to where it's used, but I could go directly. [* ](https://youtu.be/O_1ls9c6wBY?t=42)

I had to roll back 2.0.5 because of unexpected issues on Android devices - which I am republishing now. As a bonus feature, I added second-order links.
