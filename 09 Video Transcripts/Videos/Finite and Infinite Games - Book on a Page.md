Hey everyone, Jolt here! This is my summary of "Finite and Infinite Games" by James P. Carse. In this video, I'm going to walk you through my book-on-a-page summary of the book. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=0)

But before diving into the actual summary, I wanted to spend just one minute explaining to you why this book and why now. I first read this book about 20 years ago, and the book had a significant impact on my life. You could say that this book played a part in my late coming of age, because at the time I was already in my late 20s. I grew up in a Christian fundamentalist family, and this book helped me reevaluate my beliefs and how I wanted to live my life. The book had a fundamental impact on my professional career as well, influencing my leadership and my approach to work and relationships altogether. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=25)

And why now? In the course of cohort five, this was the book that we all read, and we all created our book-on-a-page summaries. So in a way, this is my homework for cohort 5 of the Visual Thinking Workshop. Let's dive in. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=66)

The course talks about two types of games: finite games and infinite games. It's important to note that one is not better than the other, but it's also crucial to know which game you're playing, as your tactics and approach to the game must match the type of game. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=88)

Finite games are games where you compete for winning or strive for the highest possible ranking. The game must be played within marked boundaries and with specified players, meaning that not everyone who wants to join the game may do so; you are selected for the game. Remember in school when you were chosen for one team or the other? This is how finite games operate. Additionally, players may be removed from the game at any time if others refuse to play with you or if you cannot play, but equally, no one can be forced to play, so whoever must play cannot play. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=108)

In terms of boundaries, there are four different types: temporal boundaries, meaning a game is played in a specific time frame with a start and end; spatial boundaries; numerical boundaries marked by a scoreboard; and finally, rules that are predefined at the start of the game and cannot change during play, else the game would become a different one. The agreement of the players to follow these rules constitutes the only agreement needed for them to apply. Examples include sports, elections, board games, negotiations, debates, the stock market, and war, among others. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=157)

On the other hand, the purpose of infinite games is to continue playing. In terms of boundaries, infinite players don’t play within boundaries; they play with boundaries. Infinite games are internally defined, and anyone may join the game. As an infinite player, you may not even know all the players who play the same game. Infinite games do have rules, but these rules are akin to the grammar of a living language. The rules of an infinite game must change throughout play, changing as necessary to ensure the game continues. Because infinite games lack boundaries, they have horizons that move as you do. In this way, infinite games open new horizons of time. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=221)

Examples of infinite games include relationships, such as marriage or friendships, education, sustainability, religions, personal growth, artistic expression, and for me personally, visual personal knowledge management is my infinite game. Common to all these games is that whoever plays, plays freely, and whoever must play cannot play. This is true for both finite and infinite games. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=303)

Now in this summary, I’m going to give you this mosaic; I’m going to talk about 16 different aspects of finite and infinite games. They are not necessarily connected to each other, though of course they all talk about the same story. Consider these as different pieces of a mosaic that you need to put together. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=319)

The first duality presented is "move" versus "touch." Touching is a reciprocal action, meaning I’m touched only if I can respond from my own center. Moving, on the other hand, is about pressing toward a place that you have already foreseen; it involves movement with a purpose. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=386)

Carse talks a lot about titles, explaining that titles are given at the end of play, while names are given at the beginning. When a person is known only by name, the attention of others is on an open future. When persons are known by a title, the attention is on a completed past — a game that has already been concluded. Titles include academic results, positions achieved at work, sports titles, and so on. Later in the book, you’ll learn that property is society's way of preserving titles, and titles are everywhere in finite games. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=411)

Another core idea from Carse is that finite games are theatrical while infinite games are dramatical. A theatrical play is a scripted performance. Sometimes it's scripted because the script pre-exists, but imagine the master player who knows all the moves; for them, the game is as if scripted. Yes, during the game, there is some level of drama, but for the master player, the game is scripted because they know what they are going to do when. This idea of theatrical play encompasses roles and masks, and the concept of changing from one role to another. Imagine an actress on stage playing the role of a mother, then stepping off at the end of play, taking on a different role, that of an actress meeting her audience. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=462)

Now, the opposite of being scripted is being open to surprise in infinite games. The drama is about being open to surprise and looking forward to an open future. In this sense, if you speak dramatically, then one chooses to be a mother; theatrically, one takes on the role of mother. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=577)

Following this idea of roles, Carse observes that seriousness is always related to roles. Imagine meeting a police officer during the day when he’s in uniform, or meeting him at night when he’s in pajamas. Your relation to him will be very different. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=585)

Related to roles is the concept of self-failing. At any time during the game, players are free to step off the field of play. However, there exists a gap between our inherent freedom and the internal necessity and urge we feel to keep up the struggle. Carse accounts for this by pointing out that we veil ourselves of this freedom; he states that we forget we have forgotten our freedom. Infinite players remember their freedom and take on these roles playfully and willfully. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=609)

This takes us to the idea of serious play versus playful play. Seriousness is rooted in the dread of unpredictable outcomes and open possibilities — it’s the dread that something will trip us up. Surprise causes finite play to end; it is a surprise move that the master player uses to close the game, leaving the loser surprised and not expecting the final move. In contrast, in infinite play, surprise is the reason the game continues. It’s like going through an open door and being ready to accept whatever surprises await on the other side and playing with that surprise — enjoying that surprise represents the playfulness and vulnerability of infinite games. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=680)

Then there's the idea of power versus strength. Power relates to the title you've already gained; power is bestowed on you by the audience. If the audience respects your title, then you have power over them. On the other hand, strength is about being able to allow others to do whatever they wish while being able to respond from your own center. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=710)

Silence versus listening is foundational to all relationships. Silence is the silence of losers; when someone wins, they are asked to give a speech, and the losers must listen. In finite speech, the speaker has a deliberate purpose with their words, and it is a predetermined process. In infinite contexts, the speaker only truly understands what they are saying when the listener responds. Innovating the listener creates the silence of expectation, offering the speaker a chance to share something personal. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=749)

Society versus culture illustrates how finite and infinite games play out at a more holistic level. Society is a subset of culture, but society is confined by boundaries and norms, while culture thrives on creativity and tradition. Society follows established power structures, while culture values deviation. If you're merely repeating a script, you're culturally impoverished. Interestingly, while society is a subset of culture, it often tries to silence culture in various ways because culture can threaten the established order. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=799)

Furthermore, Carse contrasts machinery and gardening. Machinery is designed to control nature and produces waste, while gardening respects nature's vitality and celebrates diversity. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=847)

The book also touches on immortality versus playing as a mortal. It highlights a contradiction: the winners of finite games achieve a title, a sort of immortality through their titles' recognition. Still, this is not an afterlife but rather an afterworld — a continued acknowledgment of their titles. In contrast, infinite players accept death as inevitable; they no longer struggle against mortality but instead struggle as mortals. Carse states that losing a game is a sort of death; finite players die at the end of each game, while infinite players experience death at any point during the game. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=876)

The topic of immortality versus mortality leads into the distinction between being cured and being healed. Carse uses the term cured to mean that you are fixed; your functional problems are addressed, and you are restored to competition. Healing, however, may not mean that you are cured from your illness, but rather that you are internally restored to play. You do not overcome your infirmities but can engage with them creatively. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=940)

To look at something is to look at it within its limitations; to truly see is to recognize those limitations themselves. Our imagination does not create within these outlines but generates the outlines themselves. Carse discusses looking out the window and seeing seagulls, explaining how artists realize they can depict the same elements in many ways, which causes art to evolve over time, shifting from one period to another. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=977)

This reminded me of a quote from Joseph Yavorski: "The world is nothing until we describe it." When we do, we create distinctions that govern our actions. We do not merely describe the world we see; rather, we see the world as we describe it. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1021)

The idea of travel is intriguing because if I sit in a car and go from location A to B, only to arrive at a hotel that looks just like my home and dine at a restaurant serving food identical to what I eat at home, then I haven't truly traveled — I have merely changed my physical location. Conversely, one can travel by remaining in the same space but recognizing that one can perceive things in many different ways. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1084)

Moving on, Carse discusses the mental travel of explanations versus narratives and later contrasts ideology with myths. In a genuine story, there is no law making any act necessary. Explanations place all apparent possibilities into a necessary context, while narratives delineate necessities in the realm of potential. Narratives and myths are open-ended, inviting possibilities, whereas explanations are closed and focus on predetermined outcomes. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1090)

Similar to explanations versus narratives, ideologies arise from myths but tend to be more closed. Myths encourage exploration and acceptance of endless questions and answers, spurring our imagination. This concept reminds me of Yuval Harari's notion of stories being the unifying force that facilitates large-scale human collaboration. I believe myths are those stories Harari discusses. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1140)

Finally, let's talk about amplification versus resonance. Imagine a choir as a unified expression of harmonious voices resonating together, contrasted with a loudspeaker, which amplifies a single voice, excluding all others. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1184)

These were the 16 dualities I identified from the book; there are many more, but I believe these 16 are sufficient to convey the core ideas. Now, let's discuss the practical implications of these concepts. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1208)

How do you take action based on a book like this? I've gathered a few points to consider: First, know which game is finite and which is infinite, as you need to play differently in each. Later on, I have a point on harnessing the power of surprise; in a finite game, surprise is your best friend if you want to win; in infinite games, surprise allows the game to continue. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1224)

Choose your games mindfully; remember you are free to join or leave any game. Embrace playfulness and resilience; there are more infinite games than you might initially think, and in such situations, playfulness and resilience are the right approach. Compile a list of all your roles and reflect on it. Challenge your limitations and rules; most limitations are self-imposed decisions. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1267)

Think about new rules and boundaries, and adapt whenever necessary. Prioritize reciprocal relationships over silencing your audience; listen, allowing others the opportunity to listen to you, creating a space for personal sharing and resonance. Challenge fixed structures and foster collaboration, especially within your personal knowledge management system. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1330)

Foster lifelong learning and exploration; for me, visual personal knowledge management embodies this lifelong learning process. Lastly, engage with myths and storytelling; Carse discusses poets' roles in reframing situations and advancing society by resolving conflicts. Storytelling and myths are vital tools for poets. [* ](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1341)

I hope you liked this summary of the book; it's a challenging read! Re-reading it this time, I often wondered how I understood it 20 years ago. Some parts required me to read three to four times to grasp fully; it was truly challenging work to comprehend these ideas but entirely worthwhile.

end](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=167) [it has spatial boundaries as well so the](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=169) [game is played in a certain area for](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=172)

has](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=180) [numerical boundaries and finally the](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=184) [game has rules the rules are predefined](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=187) [at the start of the game and cannot](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=191) [change during the game else the game](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=193) [would be a different game](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=196) [the agreement of the players to follow](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=198) [these rules constitutes all the](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=201) [agreement that is needed for these rules](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=204) [to apply](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=206) [examples include Sports elections board](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=208) [games

it's](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=470) [scripted because the script pre-exists](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=474) [but imagine the master player who knows](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=477)

is](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=485) [some level of drama but for the master](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=488) [player the game is scripted because he](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=492) [knows what he's going to do when](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=495) [with this idea of theatrical play comes](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=499) [the idea of roles and masks and the idea](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=502) [of changing one role to the other](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=505) [imagine the actress standing on stage](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=508) [right

different](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=517) [role the role of an actress meeting her](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=520) [audience](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=523) [you can imagine that she's

she's](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=530) [playing with her audience](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=533) [and you can also imagine that she's](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=535) [playing a number of other roles because](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=538) [when she gets home to her family or](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=540) [meets her parents or meets

is](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=550) [being open to surprise in infinite games](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=554) [the drama is about being open to](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=558) [surprise it's looking forward to an open](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=561) [Future](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=564) [in this sense if you speak dramatically](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=565) [then

[related to roles is this idea of](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=603) [self-failing at any time during the game](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=606) [the players are free to step off the](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=609) [field of play](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=612) [but there's this gap between our](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=614) [inherent freedom and the internal](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=616) [necessity and urge we feel to keep at](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=619) [the struggle](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=622) [course accounts for this by veiling](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=624) [ourselves of this Freedom he actually](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=627) [says that we forget that we have](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=629) [forgotten our freedom](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=632) [infinite players remember their freedom](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=635) [and they take on these roles playfully](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=637) [and willfully](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=640) [this takes us to this idea about Sirius](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=643) [play versus playful

finite play to end it is](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=661) [a surprise move how the master player](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=665) [closes the game and the loser stands](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=668) [there surprised not expecting the final](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=672) [move](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=675) [on the other hand in infinitely surprise](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=676) [is the reason infinite play continues](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=680) [it's like going through this open door](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=683) [and being ready and prepared to accept](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=685) [whatever surprise evades me on the other](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=689) [side and playing with that surprise](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=692) [enjoying that surprise](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=696) [that's the playfulness and vulnerability](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=699) [of infinite gains](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=702) [then there's this idea about power](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=705) [versus strength](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=708) [power is related to the title

[whatever they wish and being able to](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=736) [respond from your Center](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=739) [silence versus listening is

going](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1012) [from one period to another](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1014) [this reminded me of this quote from](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1018) [Joseph yavorski that the world is](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1021) [nothing until we describe it](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1025) [and when we do we create distinctions](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1029) [that govern our actions](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1032) [we do not describe the world we see](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1035) [but we see the world with the Scribe](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1038) [and I hope that you also noticed the two](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1044) [faces looking at each other not only the](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1047) [Grail](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1050) [the idea of travel is an interesting](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1052) [idea because if I sit in a car and](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1055) [travel from location A to B and then go](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1057) [to a hotel room that looks exactly the](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1060) [same as my home and then go to a](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1063) [restaurant and eat the same type of food](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1065) [that I eat at home then in a sense I](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1067) [haven't really traveled I've only](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1072) [changed my physical location on the](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1074) [other hand I can travel by staying in](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1077) [the same place but recognizing that I](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1080) [can look at things in a

of explanations](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1090) [versus narrative and later on ideology](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1093) [versus myths](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1098) [in a genuine story there is no law that](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1099) [makes any act necessary](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1103) [explanations place all apparent](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1106) [possibilities into the context of the](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1109) [necessary while stories set all the](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1112) [Necessities into the context of

possibilities](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1124) [explanations are closed they are about](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1128) [predetermined outcomes and the necessity](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1132) [that leads to that outcome](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1135) [similar to explanations versus](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1138) [narratives

accept](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1147) [none of it meaning that good myths are](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1150) [endless sources of question and answers](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1154) [and they will keep our imagination going](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1157) [this reminded me of you while harare's](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1161) [concept about Stories being the unifying](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1164) [force that made human collaboration at](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1167) [scale possible this is the idea that he](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1170) [talks about the incapians](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1173) [and I think myths are those stories that](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1175) [Harare is talking about](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1179) [and finally let's talk about](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1182) [amplification versus resonance](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1184) [imagine a choir as a unified expression](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1188) [of voices](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1191) [resonating with each other and imagine a](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1193) [loudspeaker which is the amplification](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1196) [of a single voice](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1199) [excluding all others](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1201) [so these were the 16 ideas dualities](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1204) [that I picked up from the book there are](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1208) [many others in the book as well but I](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1211) [thought that this 16 is enough to get](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1214) [the point across but now let's talk a](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1217) [bit about the](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1220) [so what](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1222) [so how do you take action on a book like](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1224) [this](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1227) [I've collected couple of points here I'm](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1228) [going to talk you through quickly on](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1230) [this](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1232) [first of all know which game is a finite](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1234) [game and which is an infinite game](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1237) [because you need to play in different](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1239) [ways in different games](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1242) [later on you will see I have this point](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1244) [about harnessing the power of surprise](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1247) [in a finite game surprise is your best](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1250) [friend if you want to win the game if](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1254) [you're able to surprise your opponent](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1257) [then you're likely going to win and in](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1259) [infinite games surprise is the way to](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1262) [continue the game](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1265) [choose your games mindfully remember](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1267) [that you're free to join the game and](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1270) [you're free to leave any game you want](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1272) [Embrace playfulness and resilience there](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1276) [are much more infinite games than you](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1280) [would first think and in those](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1282) [situations playfulness and resilience](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1285) [are the right approach](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1288) [compile a list of all your roles and](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1290) [reflect on that list](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1294) [challenge yourself limitations and rules](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1296) [most of the limitations that you](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1299) [experience are your own decisions](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1301) [think about new rules new boundaries and](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1305) [adapt the rules than ever necessary](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1309) [prioritize reciprocal relations instead](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1312) [of silencing your audience listen to](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1316) [others and create relationships where](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1320) [others listen to you creating the](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1322) [opportunity for you to share and to](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1325) [resonate with others](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1328) [challenge fixed structures and promote](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1330) [collaboration this is something you can](https://youtu.be/I5vvnV1JdkY?t=1334) [also do in your own personal
