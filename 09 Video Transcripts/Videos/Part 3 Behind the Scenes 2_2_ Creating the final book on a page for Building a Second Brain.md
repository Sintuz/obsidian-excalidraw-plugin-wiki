# Content
Hey everyone, yesterday I completed the first pass of highlighting my notes from Thiago's book, "Building a Second Brain," and I also added my first sketches as I was reflecting on words, expressions, and thoughts in the document. We also went through, at the end of yesterday's piece, on these drawings, and I gave you a bit of a background on the different stories that I'm telling with these drawings. Today, I want to move on to compiling my book on a page, or at least creating a first draft of my book on a page. [* ](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=0)

The way I'm going to do this is I'm going to open this document I have here in a pop-out window, and I'm just going to put this on the side. You will not see this; this is outside the screen, but it's on my screen, so I'm using an extra white screen. Practically, the window that you're seeing is just a small piece of the entire screen, so I've placed this on the side. I'm going to navigate up; I have Excalibrain open on the other side, so I'm going to navigate up one level in this document. I'm going to open the page for the book itself. So far, I was working in the literature notes folder, and now I'm going to open the book on a page. [* ](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=38)

I'm going to convert this into an Excalidraw drawing, so I press Ctrl + P and choose "convert empty node to Excalidraw drawing". Here I have this empty note, and now what I'm going to do first is I'm just going to pile up the different components here. I will scroll down this document; I have already some thoughts of what I want to use. I'm not copying at this moment everything, but I am going to be copying bits and pieces. First of all, I thought I would copy this drawing right here, so I'm going to open this, and I'm just going to Ctrl + A, select everything, Ctrl + C, and Ctrl + V to bring this over to this page. [* ](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=90)

I'm also going to scroll on and copy some other pieces as well. I was in particular, I think I'm going to use this drawing as well. Actually, I'm going to Ctrl + A, Ctrl + C, so I'm going to copy some of these elements here. Let me do that, and I'll come back to you in a second when I've copied all the pieces I wanted, and then I'll start to arrange these on the page to start to build up the book on the page. I have a concept already, and overnight that’s also one benefit of leaving this and coming back to it the next day. Overnight I thought through how I would want to arrange this; my idea is that I want to put code in the middle, especially I want to use this drawing. [* ](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=143)

I'm looking for, so for now, we'll skip Mr. Feynman, and I wanted to put this picture in the middle. So this divergence and convergence with the code and what I'm thinking to do is I'm copying this over here as well. What I'm thinking to do is I'm going to have the four elements of code, so capture up here, and then organize down here because those are the more divergent parts of the process, and then I'm going to have this still here, and express down here. I want to organize these four parts, and I want this diamond in the center of my drawing. So that's my concept of how I want to arrange my book on a page. I'm still thinking if I want to add two additional things to this drawing; I'm not quite sure. [* ](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=181)

I was thinking of somehow including a reference to Zettelkasten and including a reference to GTD, getting things done, because those concepts and workflows also very closely relate to Tiago's methodology. I think that’s true, but let me continue on moving the various bits and pieces here. This talks about the superpowers of a second brain, and I think that's definitely an important part of the story of the why. [* ](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=303)

I'm also thinking about references, so this is what I might do. I'm going to type here the superpowers of a second brain like this, and I'm going to add a block reference to this. Superpower, that's going to be my block reference, and then what I'm planning to do is here, let me just bring in a link to the literature notes like this. Because I want to link some of these drawings back to my original literature note, the way I'm going to do this is I have this bookmark or block reference for superpower. So I'm going to edit this link that I just dragged and dropped here, and I'm going to put a hashtag here, and then I'm going to put the block reference. [* ](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=354)

This should now turn into the superpowers of the second brain, but the benefit of having this like this right here is, if I hover this, then it will bring up my document right here. You can see, so it jumped immediately to the superpowers of the second brain. For me, this is practical. The reason, so let me just test one thing. You see, this is what happens when you forget what your software is capable of. Let me just see what happens if I do this. Let me add an empty character afterward so it refreshes. Yeah, so this is why I created a new line, because if I just put a block reference to this title row, then it will bring all the markdown content with that, which I don’t want. I just want the pure text. [* ](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=420)

So in my literature notes, I'm adding this line which is, you could say, a bookmark in my literature notes that I can reference right here. I'm going to come here and change the text; I need to update the text because that's my next call. It recognizes that it needs to refresh this embedded text, so you can see I have my superpowers of the second brain here, and I have the link as well, that takes me to this part of the document, which is great. So I'll just continue on to see what else I want to do. I wanted to bring Mr. Feynman in as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=477)

I very much like this concept of the 12 favorite problems and this filtering. I firmly believe in this concept of having some topics that you're working on and collecting information about those as you go along your day. [* ](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=505)

Okay, so I have everything from the book. I probably am going to create some more references as I create the drawing, but overall, what you can see is I have now this whiteboard of sketches that I pulled together from yesterday's sketching as I was doing the highlighting and doing some of these sketches. Now I'm going to spend, I'm guessing it's going to take about an hour to process all of this into a nice looking book on a page. So see you on the other side. [* ](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=610)

I am ready with my book on a page. I think overall it looks good; I think it's a little bit too busy, so I probably need more time to distill this further and to condense the information. But on the other hand, Tiago's book was very rich with lots of valuable content. I ended up structuring my book on a page into three parts, and I drew this red rectangle to signify the central decor piece of my book on a page and of the book itself. On the left-hand side, I have some of the introductory content, just the whole story about the promise of the second brain, the superpowers of having a second brain, and some of the legacy of the second brain such as the commonplace books. [* ](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=707)

I think the reference to getting things done, as well as this whole idea that creativity doesn't happen by chance, but it's the result of a process. Then the centerpiece is organized around code just to make it clear; I added these big red texts because what I did is I have the capture, or everything related to capture, here on the top left, everything related to organize is down here in the bottom left, this still is the top right, and then express is the bottom right. [* ](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=764)

What I found was that Tiago, or maybe it's not so much Tiago, but it’s me, I highlighted more around the express part. I think that's because my capture also organizes, and some of my distilled processes are sort of in place. I'm working on the express share your work part, and for that reason, I finally decided to create this right-hand side column that talks about these two things. It actually covers these three strategies to bring creative work together that really fits under express, but I decided that it's also a habit or a strategy, a workflow kind of thing. [* ](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=868)

Then also these essential habits of starting the project with a checklist and finishing the project with the checklist; doing monthly and weekly reviews, as well as the noticing habits; so building your second brain in small bits, those for me fit under the habits part. So in the end, it is a busy page. It does contain a huge part of the book; however, there are some bits and pieces. For example, I don't talk about the project closeout checklist; frankly, I didn’t find it so insightful. I don't talk about the monthly checklist because it also aligns quite a bit with getting things done monthly checklist. Frankly, for me, that's already known, and there are some other bits and pieces that I decided to leave out. [* ](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=988)

Overall, I think this page now captures the essence of the book, and later on, if I pull this page up, I will find this very useful in understanding what the book was about and to remind myself of the code process and overall remind myself of the good practices that are covered in Tiago's book. So I hope you liked this walkthrough of how I created this book on a page, and as always, I welcome your feedback, your comments, so please in the comments leave your thoughts and let’s have a discussion. Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1098)

to](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=82) [open the page for the book itself and](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=84) [you can see that so far i was working in](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=88) [the literature notes](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=90) [folder and now i'm going to open the](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=92) [book on a page](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=95) [i'm going to convert this into an x](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=97) [collider drawing so i press ctrl p](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=99) [and i choose](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=102) [convert](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=104) [empty node to x color draw drawing so](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=108) [here i have this empty note and now what](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=111) [i'm going to do first is i'm just going](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=114) [to pile up the different components here](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=116) [so i will scroll down this document i](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=119) [have already some thoughts of what i](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=122) [want to use i'm not copying at this](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=124) [moment](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=126) [everything but i am going to be copying](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=127) [bits and pieces](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=130) [first of all i thought](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=132) [i would](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=134) [copy this drawing right here so i'm](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=135) [going to open this](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=138) [and i'm just going to control](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=140) [a select everything ctrl c](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=143) [and ctrl v bring this over to this](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=146) [page](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=150) [i'm also going to](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=151) [then scroll on and we'll](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=153) [copy some other pieces as well](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=156) [i was](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=159) [in particular i think i'm going to use](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=161) [this drawing as well](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=164) [actually i'm going to](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=166) [ctrl a ctrl c so i'm going to copy some](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=167) [of these elements here](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=171) [let me do that and i'll come back to you](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=172) [in a second when i've copied all the](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=174) [pieces i wanted and then i'll start to](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=177) [arrange these on the page to start to](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=180) [build up the book on the page i have a](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=182) [concept already so overnight that's also](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=185) [one benefit of](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=188) [leaving this and coming back to it the](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=190) [next day overnight i](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=193) [thought through how i would want to](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=195) [arrange this my idea is that i want to](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=198) [put code in the middle especially i want](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=201) [to use this drawing i'm looking for](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=204) [so for now we'll skip mr feyman and](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=208) [i wanted to put this picture in the](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=213) [middle](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=215) [so this divergence convergence with the](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=216) [code and what i'm thinking to do](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=219) [is to create so i'm copying this over](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=222) [here as well](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=225) [so what i'm thinking to do is i'm going](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=228) [to have](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=230) [the four elements of code so capture up](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=232) [here and then organize down here because](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=235) [those are the more](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=238) [divergent part of the process and then](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=241) [i'm going to have this still here and](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=243) [express down here so i'm going to](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=246) [organize these four parts and i want](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=249) [this diamond in the center of my drawing](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=253) [so that's my concept of how i want to](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=256) [arrange my book on a page i'm still](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=260) [thinking if i want to put two additional](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=263) [things on this drawing i'm not quite](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=266) [sure](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=269) [i was thinking of somehow](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=270) [including a reference to zettelkasten](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=272) [and](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=275) [including a reference to gtd getting](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=276) [things done](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=278) [because those concepts and workflows](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=280) [also very closely relate to thiago's](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=282) [methodology i'll think that's true](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=286) [but yeah so let me continue on moving](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=289) [the various bits and pieces here](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=292) [this talks about the support powers of a](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=301) [second brain and i think](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=303) [that's definitely an important part of](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=306) [the story of the why](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=308) [[Music]](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=310) [i'm also thinking](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=315) [that in terms of references so this is](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=318) [what i might do i'm going to type here](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=321) [the super](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=323) [powers of a](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=327) [second](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=329) [brain like this and i'm going to add](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=330) [a](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=334) [block reference to this so](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=335) [super](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=337) [power](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=338) [that's going to be my block reference](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=339) [and then what i'm planning to do is here](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=342) [let me just](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=346) [bring in a link to the literature notes](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=348) [like this](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=351) [and because i want to link some of these](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=352) [drawings back to my](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=355) [original literature note so the](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=358) [way i'm going to do this is i have this](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=361) [bookmark here or block reference](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=365) [for super power so i'm going to

put](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=380) [the block reference so this should now](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=382) [turn into the superpowers of the second](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=385)

will](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=397) [bring up](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=399) [my document right here you can see so it](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=401) [jumped](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=404) [immediately to the superpowers of the](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=405) [second brain and for me this is](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=407) [practical the reason](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=409) [so let me just test one thing](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=412) [you see this is what happens when you](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=415) [forget](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=417) [what your software is capable of](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=418) [let me just see what happens if i do](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=422) [this](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=424) [let me add an empty](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=429) [character afterwards so it

the pure text so in my](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=450) [literature notes i'm adding this line](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=453) [which is you could say a bookmark in

the](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1172) [legacy of the second brain such as the](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1174) [commonplace books i think the reference](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1177) [to getting things done](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1180) [as well as this whole idea that](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1182) [creativity doesn't happen by chance but](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1184) [it's the result of a process](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1186) [then the centerpiece is organized around](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1188) [code just to make it clear](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1193) [i added these big](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1196) [red texts because what i did is i have](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1197) [the capture or everything related to](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1201) [capture here on the top left](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1204) [everything related to organize is down](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1208) [here in the bottom left](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1210) [this still is the top right](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1212) [and then express is the bottom right](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1215) [and what i found was that thiago](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1218) [or maybe it's not so much thiago but](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1223) [it's jolt so myself](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1225) [i highlighted more](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1228) [around the express part i think that's](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1229) [because my capture](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1232) [also organized and some of my distilled](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1234) [processes are sort of in place i'm](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1237) [working on the express share your work](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1240) [part](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1243) [and for that reason i finally decided to](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1244) [put or create this right hand side](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1248) [column](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1250) [that the habits and strategies which](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1251) [talk about two things it actually covers](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1254) [these three strategies to bring

a habit or](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1264) [a strategy a workflow kind of thing](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1268) [and then also these essential habits](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1271) [of starting the project with a checklist](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1274) [and finishing the project with the](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1278) [checklist](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1279) [doing monthly and weekly reviews as well](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1280) [as the noticing habits so building your](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1284) [second brain in small bits](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1288) [those for me fits the habits part so in](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1291) [the end it

for](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1301) [example i don't talk about the](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1304) [project closeout checklist frankly i](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1306) [didn't find it so insightful i don't](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1309) [talk about the monthly](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1312) [checklist because it also quite much](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1314) [aligns with getting things done monthly](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1316) [checklist frankly for me that's already](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1319) [known and there are some other bits and](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1322) [pieces that i decided to leave out but](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1324) [overall i think](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1328) [this page now captures the adsense of](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1329) [the book and later on if i pull this](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1332) [page up i will find this very useful in](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1335) [understanding what the book was about](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1339) [and to remind myself of the code process](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1341) [reminds myself of pera and overall](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1344) [remind myself of the good practices that](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1348) [are](https://youtu.be/Mo-o4c2pzYE?t=1351)
