![Rethinking MY PKM: How I Organize Everything In Obsidian](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A)

# Summary
In this video, the creator discusses their personal knowledge management (PKM) system utilizing Obsidian, outlining six key principles and 14 components that guide their organization methods. They emphasize the importance of simplicity, minimizing friction, and maximizing findability through various strategies like using LATCH (Location, Alphabet, Time, Category, Hierarchy) and maintaining links between notes. The video also features practical examples of folder structures, tagging strategies, and the use of visual tools like ExcaliDraw and Excalibrain to enhance their PKM experience.

# Key Takeaways
- **Keep It Simple:** Each component of the PKM system has a clear and singular purpose.
- **Minimize Friction:** Utilize tools like Templater and Data View to automate and streamline workflows.
- **Accept Brownfield Reality:** Acknowledging the complexity of integrating past PKM systems into a current setup.
- **Avoid Moving Files:** Maintain consistent locations of files to prevent broken links.
- **Utilize the LATCH Method:** Organize information by Location, Alphabet, Time, Category, and Hierarchy to improve findability.
- **Prioritize Linking:** Ensure that all notes are linked to enhance discoverability and context.

# Content
Hey everyone! In today's video, I'm going to share with you how I organize everything in Obsidian. This is the end of a long journey that started almost a year ago when I first published "Rethinking My PKM." Since then, I've been releasing various videos on the topic, and now I'm ready to share how my entire system works. So in today's video, we are going to look at the six principles of my PKM and the 14 components of my system. For each of the components, I'm going to try to give you multiple examples from my Vault. Also, the drawing that I'm going to use in today's video will be included in the description, so you can open this ExcaliDraw drawing and find lots of additional information, links to various videos I've shared, and links to blog posts and other materials, so you can really dive into the topic that interests you the most. Just a quick reminder: the Visual Thinking Workshop Cohort 4 is starting this Saturday. If you're interested in learning more about visual thinking and organizing your information in Obsidian, this is an awesome opportunity to meet with me and work together. I’d love for you to join Cohort 4. [* ](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=0)

So now, let's dive in and start with the six principles. My first principle is to keep it simple. Each component, each of the 14 components, has a clear purpose and a single purpose, and I try to keep these separate from one another so I don't get confused about it. Second, I'm keen on minimizing friction. I use two primary tools for this: Templater and Data View, but of course, there are some other automations as well. Automation is an important part of my workflow. Third, I live in the Brownfield reality, and I bet most of you do as well. This means that I've had previous PKM systems where I stored information. I had my file system, so every time I upgrade my PC, I store the previous PC's content in a folder called "Archive." This is an archive in an archive in an archive going back to the 1990s, so there's lots of stuff. Also, I use multiple tools like The Brain, Evernote, Roam Research, etc., and I've imported materials from there. This means that overall my Vault is a mess. I try to get on top of the categories, tags, or folders, but it is really hard with this Brownfield reality, and I decided to accept reality for what it is. [* ](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=100)

Fourth, I'm keen on avoiding moving files around. I make this point because Thiago Forte in "Building a Second Brain" proposes a workflow where you move files into a folder for the project and when the project completes, move your files to somewhere else. I don’t like to move files around because then links break. Even in Obsidian, where you get some control around it, there are some issues with moving files around. So I place the file somewhere and I stick to that location, even if it sometimes means that things don’t end up in their correct folders. Fifth, I apply LATCH. LATCH stands for Location, Alphabet, Time, Category, and Hierarchy, and this was coined by Richard Wurman, who is the founder of TED Talks. He said that everything in the world can be organized by these five means, and by these five means only. The way I apply LATCH—or the reason I apply LATCH—is to maximize how I can find information. I can find information based on my calendar, I can find the information based on the physical location if it was for some reason memorable, I can find it based on categories, and with the other methods as well. Using LATCH and applying LATCH to each piece of information in my Vault helps me maximize findability. Finally, I always link. Now, this is something that I've not been always deliberate on. I looked at how many orphan files I have in my Vault and I was surprised to see that it was in the high hundreds, meaning five or six hundred orphan files. This is because often I'm using folders in a way that they provide a structure and often I simply place a document with the topic in that file, but of course, that reduces findability. So recently, I’ve decided that I'm only going to place files in my Vault if I'm able to link it to somewhere in my Graph. These are my principles. Then let's dive into each of the tools. I’m going to start with folders. First of all, you can see my folder hierarchy here. It’s a relatively lean folder hierarchy, so you can see these are my folders. There are some folders that I would love to get rid of, but because I don’t want to move files and because of the Brownfield reality, I cannot. So, archive: The Brain is there. It has lots and lots of files, where you can see it has almost 4,500 files and a thousand subfolders. So that is a big mess. But also Hobbies—I would love to move on their projects, but again, lots of files here, lots of folders, and I just decided to leave it there. By the way, I think of folders not as physical storage locations but as namespaces. [* ](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=205)

So let me show you what I mean by that. When I create a new link to a file that doesn't exist in my Vault, let's imagine I'm adding a new book to my Vault and I want to add the author. I don't just write the name of the author, for example, Dan Rome, but I create the author in the People Authors namespace, which simply means that I type in—and here in search we can actually take a look at this—so I type in a link that starts with people, then slash author, and then I continue with the name of the author. So in this case, you can see I have a number of ghost links. A ghost link means that the actual folder for the author has not been created yet. So you can see here Dan Rome or Eliezer Yudkowsky; you can see here a couple of Hungarian poets as well as some other authors. By doing this, then I create the file, or when I create the link to the name of the person, I can already give it a type. I know it's an author even without creating the file and adding a tag. "Author" to me is helpful. [* ](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=352)

Second, I like folders because they help me manage what gets synchronized with Obsidian Sync. So here in Obsidian Sync settings, you can actually specify excluded folders. So here on my Mac, I have nothing; all my videos are on my desktop PC. There, I have lots of folders that are in the exclude because, for example, I exclude all the folders with the video files and voice files because they are large and there’s no point in synchronizing them. However, I keep them in Obsidian, but I can ring fence that content and not move it around with Obsidian Sync. And then, I try to name YouTube project files and other files as well, or rather folders, with a year-month-date naming. This is something new that I've started, so I don’t really have many examples of this, but here you will see that some of the folders that have been created recently follow this naming convention. What this helps me with is it gives me a chronological order for my videos because you can see I have a whole bunch of files here, and sometimes it is a bit difficult to find the video. However, I do remember the time when I created that video. In Obsidian, you can set up the attachments folder and also the new file. So here, if I come to settings under files and links, there are these additional settings that you can create. So first of all, the default location for new notes for me is the same folder as the current file, which means that if I'm working on a topic and I just simply write the name of a new file—not using the namespace—then that file is going to be created in the same folder. If I want to place it somewhere else, then I follow this namespace approach and I type out the location of the file. Second, I keep my attachments under the subfolder of the topic. For me, attachments and the notes are very closely connected, and this is why for me, this makes sense. So for example, here, if I come to input, this is where all my inputs are: for example, articles and assessments and books, and conferences films. Here’s, for example, my book notes on "Deep Work," and you can see here that I have my attachments folder, which includes all my illustrations for "Deep Work." So that’s about folders. Now, moving on to tags: I only use one tag per page. There’s one exception to this, which is more of a stylistic thing, and I didn’t even include it here, but you will see it in the next step when I talk about Data View and how I’m using search. For now, the point is I aim to give a single tag to each document, and that will give that document a type. For example, if we open this page and I’m going to navigate here, if I open this page, you can see that this is a map of content and you can see I have my tag "map of content" here. Now, if I open Excalibrain for this page, then what you will see here is that based on the tag on the page, I’m going to give this file a different look and feel in Excalibrain. So all my maps of contents are with this red color and have this icon of a map there. All my people file—so you can see a couple of people here, Thiago Fort and Nick Milo, they have this person icon at the beginning. All my books have this book icon there, then I have Excalidraw drawings that have this painter's palette icon there, etc. So I use the tag for the page to also define the look and feel of this page in Excalibrain and just to show you how I configure this in Excalibrain. If I come to Excalibrain settings, I can scroll down here: here are all the different tags listed that I'm using in my Vault with a special purpose. Here, if I choose one of the tags—let’s look at the MoC that we looked at a second ago—you can see that I have my prefix, which is this map emoji, and then I have the background color and the text color specified, and I can see how these are going to look. And for example, if I look at a person, then you can see that this is how a person node looks like in Excalibrain. I need to add these tags here, and then they appear here in the list. Finally, on tags, I have this article call, and on the link that I'm going to include in the show notes, that will take you to excalidraw.com, with this drawing there, you will find this link, and you can click on it. Back in the time when I was working in "The Brain," I had this whole color scheme of how I used the different thought types, and these are actually the equivalents of tags or the way I use them in Obsidian. I had different color ranges, so red range was all the media that I consumed, the yellow range was for example all the people: friends, family, colleagues, all these purple items were companies or legal entities, etc. So each color had its own purpose and then I looked at my graph. Then I was able to understand it immediately, or understand it much better. [* ](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=691)

So moving on, talking about links, we’re going to look back to my PKM MoC and you will see how I'm using links here. So, or the ontology, the ontology is defined here in the front by this Data View field with double columns after it, and I have the link. The way this is going to appear on the graph in Excalibrain is here. If you take a look, you will see that these tags that are here on the left-hand side appear here as related to examples, examples, examples, etc. The author, you have the different types of relationships. So I use the ontology in my Vault and I use it to describe the relationship between this file and the next file. To me, this helps to think about why I have that link there and what the purpose of the link is. Coming up with the ontology is sometimes a challenge. In Excalibrain, there’s a feature that I get prompted with these ontologies. So if I type triple double colon, then this list comes up and I can just simply type and I’ll get all the different types of ontologies I have defined, and each of these has a definition index color in Excalibrain, whether they’re a parent, a child, or a friend. So again, here in Excalibrain, you can see that these are all the fields that are parents or children and friends; I have some excluded ontologies for some other technical reasons, and I have also a couple of unregistered ones that I either still need to register to make it explicit in Excalibrain or they’re just there because over time these were created anyway. So this trigger—oh, and let me just show you this—so you can see here, you have the ontology suggester as something you can turn on, and then using these features, these hot combinations the suggester comes up. So if I only want to see friend relationships, then these are all the types of ontologies I can apply here that will create a lateral link in Excalibrain for me. The lateral link, just to show you that as well, will look like this. Everything here—the central idea is the document I have open, and everything on the left-hand side are lateral links. These are parent links and these are children nodes. So that’s the logic, and I use the ontology to specify where each item gets on my graph. Linking also includes embedding items into the Excalidraw storyboard. So again, let me just show you how this storyboard looks like. So the document we are looking at right now—again, I’m going to open Excalibrain, and now in the center, you can see that this is the file we are looking at. So this is my PKM design text links folder ontology MoC Zettel custom, etc. You can see that all of these items that are embedded here are also present here. So for example, here I have this calendar icon that’s embedded. I’m not going to navigate to this because that will take us off on a tangent, but you can see already that this icon is actually used in four other places. So it’s used in five places. So already with this, I'm making a connection to somewhere else where I talk about time and calendaring, etc. But so for me, when I embed an object into my Excalidraw storyboard for a topic, then that already will create a link. On the ontology, we already talked about the ontology bit, so we are going to take this topic off as well. The ontology describes the relationship between notes and I differentiate between parent, child, and lateral connections. I implemented with Data View fields and I visualize it with Excalibrain. Here’s a video where I talk about this in more detail. [* ](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=917)

Then, the next important element of my organization system is I'm trying to work with atomic nodes and use transclusion. For example, as I just mentioned with the calendar item, and maybe we can actually navigate to that calendar to see where else we are using the calendar. So by reusing—or maybe here’s the checkmark, and we’re going to navigate to this. By clicking here, this will open the checkmark, and here I can come to the various documents. For example, evaluating evidence, this is actually a part of my book on a page for the book "Rationality." So here, I’m using exactly the same checkmark and using the same checkmark, I can navigate to the topic. Sometimes these links are irrelevant; oftentimes this comes as an interesting surprise that, yes, that visual link that I reused also provides contextual linking. So that’s about atomic notes. I also use the construction of images. There are two videos here; I’m not going to go into this because this is a big rabbit hole that goes down into how I deconstruct ExcaliDraw drawings into sub-drawings. But this is a very important part of my whole methodology of reusing components, not redrawing, and using these components to create links. But also I try to do this by creating consistent sections in my other notes as well. So here are two examples: here’s an example of an article, and you will see that the article has a summary section. By the way, if you look at my book notes, then the book note also has a summary section. By having this commonality, I know that if I'm referencing a book, I can immediately write #summary and just get the summary embedded into the location. So if I transclude this—so let’s say I open today’s daily node and I want to transclude "Building a Second Brain" summary, so then I would write “Building a Second Brain” like this. I would immediately write #summary, and with this, I’m able to embed this here, and I would also probably add a reference here. So in this case, the reason I’m putting this here is that this is an example. So I would add my ontology like this, but by having this consistent approach of always calling the summary "summary," this just simplifies my life because with this consistency I can easily embed items and reference them. The same with quotes. Don't ask me why I ended up with P, but every quote that I have—so for example, here’s the daily quote from today—if I look here in markdown, then you will see that here I have this quote from Napoleon Hill, and here I have this reference with P. Again, I know that if there's a quote—a single quote in a file—that is worth referencing, then it’s going to have a block reference P, and that just helps me easily find these items in my Vault. This example book is a good example for section headings. So there is a trade-off between embedding files and references, or creating larger files. If I look at "Building a Second Brain," you can see here that I have a couple of notes here, and these notes are just simply typed here, so I’m not embedding anything here. In this case, I made some notes about the book, some of my research as I was reading the book, and here under notes, I simply added these items, and that’s all. But for example, if I would open another book—I’m going to open, for example, "Emergence"—so if I open "Emergence," then here you will see that I had a bit more content here. In this case, I included or transcluded content here, and in some of them I only transcluded the summary; in other cases, I transcluded the whole material. But in these cases, the files actually live in their proper location, so this file lives here in its input folder under YouTube. This is the input YouTube folder; that’s where the file is, and here it’s a block reference. You can see this as a block reference. So that's the trade-off. If I have lots of files or lots of notes that I want to include, then I start to break them out into their relevant files and I make them embeds that have a link. If I don't have that many, I typically start by typing these topics here and then break them out later if I feel that that is required. [* ](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1244)

So moving on, let’s move up to the top here. File names! I have a couple of file naming conventions which I find pretty helpful. All my MoCs start with an underscore, like you can see here. Let’s just show you some of the other MoCs. If I come to Excalibra, I think with that we can also cover MLC. So here these are the various maps of contents in my Vault. You can see these right here, and you can see that each of them has the same file name. But similarly, I have naming conventions. For example, "book cover" will bring up all the book covers I have in my Vault, or if I type in "logo," then this will bring all the logo images. If I type "icon," then it will show all the icons in my Vault. I also use this; I have some automations around it. I’m going to include that link here as well. So here, if I open the image library—so it’s here—I also have a local library, so maybe let’s open the local library. Then this will show me all the logos in my Vault; all of these files will start with the word "logo." So there’s my—I can see my Apple logo here. If I press Ctrl + O and type "logo," Apple logo, then you can see that indeed that Apple logo is right there. Also in my naming convention, you can see that at the end—in this case and in most cases—my file name has three parts. It specifies the type of file: is it a book cover, a logo, an illustration, a photo, an icon, a whatever? Then there’s the actual keywords that define the file. So in this case, it’s "Apple logo," but for example, if I open my image library, then here you’ll see that I have longer file names in my image library. So these are all the icons in my Vault, and here you can see that you see the "headache," "frustration," "anger" are the keywords, and then the final part of the naming convention you will see here as well is the source of the file. So in this case, it’s "flat icon," but if the source is something else, then it’s going to be that other source. So these are the various naming conventions. You can see here "book cover," "illustration," "thumbnail," "book on the page" starts with Bob, "literature note" starts with Ln, etc. The date format I use is year-year, month-month, and day-day because that consistent naming helps me find stuff easier. Then I use templates, and I have lots of templates. So here, if I open my template folder, templates—or templates—so you can see I have a whole bunch of templates. I actually follow again the naming convention here as well, so I have templates that create a new line, so it just creates a single line in the document, and I have templates that create new pages, and I have some other templates as well. For many of the things I do, I use these templates, and then some of my templates actually automate the process of creating folders and multiple files. If there's a more complex activity, then I use that. For example, the YouTube workflow video that I explained here will show you a case study where I have a template that creates files and folders and places stuff in all the places, and the Excalidraw templates show you different ways how you can create graphical templates—maybe pre-filled templates for various tasks. So templates are an important part of my setup. [* ](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1805)

I already talked about ontology, and frankly, we already looked at the maps of content as well. Here’s another map of content just as an example. This is my map of content about sketchnoting. Again, you can see here all the different ontologies and links. You can see lots of material here. So this is my map of content for sketchnoting, and I have a good number of maps of content to summarize various topics that I’m working on. Some of these—so for example, here, this map of content also has some visual summaries as well, so for example, this is a summary about some sketchnoting, listing some sketchnoters, some YouTube channels, some books, and some stuff about visual vocabulary, etc. Then moving on, the way I use daily notes is I use daily notes to create the time hierarchy based on LATCH. This is the time aspect, and then we’re going to talk about geotags, and that’s going to be the location aspect of organizing information. So if we look at this holiday last year in June, we went to Rome with my wife. What I want to show you here is here—if I click—first I need to open the right-hand side so we have the map here with all sorts of different locations, and here if I open this to show this on the map, then you can see that this has actually a location here, and you can also see the other components of our visit: the tickets to Vatican City and to the Colosseum. Just going further on here—here’s earlier this year we went to Sicily and we visited the Valley of the Temples, and the Turkish stairs as well as moved around here. We’ve had to Etna as well, so here’s the family on Etna. This is, I think, a very useful way to organize information. I'm using the Map View plugin. This is the Map View plugin right here; this is the settings for that. I find this very practical. You can add geo tags, so this is here—a geo tag. If I click here, then you will see that this is a geo tag based actually—in this case—a lat long coordinates, but this can also be an address depending on the type of link we are talking about. You can also see that I'm using the check-in checkout inline ontology here. So the way this looks in Excalibrain, and that's where we come back to the daily note linkage. So if I now again open Excalibrain, then you will see that our vacation in Rome is linked to these days. So this is when we were in Rome. You can also see we were in Vatican City and the Colosseum, and you can see some other information here as well. But the point is, by adding check-in and checkout, I can know when we arrived and when we left. By linking all of these events to the daily note, through the daily note, I can navigate my history and look at what happened on that day. I'm not going to open the daily note because that typically contains some personal information as well that I don’t want to share, but the idea is these daily notes—you can see here are linked to one another with the "tomorrow" link, and so this creates this chain of days. Each day, I'm linking what is happening on that day. Maybe to show you just one more example, if we come to this page right here, then this page is linked to today's date right there, and this is when I'm working on it. You can also see that this is linked to a couple of days ago as well, and I also worked on this so I know on what days I worked on this specific material. So that actually covers daily notes as my time hierarchy and geotags. Now, I like to see tasks in the context where I need to talk about them. In my normal work, I have many projects happening in my organization, and I deal with lots of people. So in each situation, I want to be reminded of the actions that we discussed with that person or with that vendor or with that project at the last time we met. I talk about this and how I do this in "It's About Time," so you can look at this video, but I want to show you how this looks in my demo Vault. This is going to be an example just to show you very quickly how this works. So for example, this is my note about Bob the Builder, and the video I'm referencing goes into more details about this and walks you through how this works. You can see here that when I am on the page for Bob the Builder, I'm immediately cognizant that there is a topic where I'm waiting for Bob. Actually, it is related to Project K, and this right here is a data view query. It’s an extremely simple data view query; I explain everything about it in the video. The point I want to show you here is I’m placing this information on the page of the person, and whenever I’m meeting someone or talking about the project or whatever other topic, I always open the page for that person or project or topic. Most of my templates—or pretty much all of my templates—include the task section. Therefore, I always get the context relevant tasks in the context when I need it. For example, you can see here there’s an action for Bob on a meeting to discuss something with Mock, and if I look at Mock's page, of course, I’m going to see all of these actions that are now for Mock, the dump truck, and you will see that there’s an action from the page about the Builder, and then there’s another action that was somehow discussed on Rowley or Vid Rowley, the steamroller, and then something from Project B. One quick side note: This is the other way I’m using tags, and I only use it in this specific instance. So I have three tags: I have the "They think," "Four Discuss With," and "Promised To." So these are three tags I use. Frankly, I don’t really search on them; I could actually categorize the data view query here based on promised to discuss with waiting for, and I had a period of time when I did that. I recognized that it didn't really matter that much. Right now, this is more for just stylistic reasons. For me, it is important to know that I noted something down because I need to talk about that with the person, or that person has promised me something and I need to wait for that, and follow it up, or maybe I promised something to that person, and I need to be cognizant of that when we meet so I can either share the results with the person or be proactive in apologizing that I haven’t yet done it. But the point is I want to be reminded. So in this case, I'm also using tags, but here, I’m not using it to define the type of the page; I'm using it just as a stylistic component to remind me of the type of action that I'm talking about. [* ](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2204)

This is also then covering the dynamic list. So tasks are in the context; then I'm using Data View fields, and then I’m using various dynamic lists. I'm not only using Data View, but I also have embedded Obsidian queries as well. Finally, I have this Diagnostics and maintenance page, and here I’m looking at stuff like orphan notes, which right now are the absolute orphans—are files that are just there; no one is pointing at them, and it is not pointing to anyone, so they are completely alone in the dark. So I have 109 at the moment of these, and then, for example, I have this list of pasted images. So I like to name the images either illustration or photo or whatever, wherever they came from. Sometimes I come here and clean up some of the pasted images that I didn’t name so I have the properly named images. So that summarizes how I organize information in Obsidian. It may be a lot, but to me, this structure helps put everything in place. The key component here is LATCH, making sure that I have multiple ways to find information either by location or alphabet, time, category, or hierarchy. Then you could see the different tools and components that I’m using to achieve this. [* ](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2544)

So that’s all I wanted to share with you. Again, just a quick reminder: If you want to learn more, if you're interested in exploring visual thinking and exploring the use of Obsidian with me, sign up for Cohort 4. You still have a couple of days to do that; I'm going to close registrations in a few days. So if you're interested, check out this page. And again, this whole mind map or visual summary that’s here, I'll include in the show notes. You’ll have a link and you can open this on excalibra.com, and from there you can either copy this into your own Obsidian or you can follow these links. So all around the page, you will see these YouTube links that will take you to various videos that are relevant to the subject, as well here you see this link to the article. So that’s all I wanted to share with you today. Thank you for watching until the end, and I hope to see you next time. [* ](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2605)

## YouTube Transcript

[hey everyone in today's video I'm going](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=0) [to share with you how I organize](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=3) [everything in obsidian this is the end](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=5) [of a long journey that started almost a](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=8) [year ago when I first published](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=10) [rethinking my PKM one and since then](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=12) [I've been releasing various videos on](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=17) [the topic and now I'm ready to share how](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=20) [my entire system works so in today's](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=24) [video we are going to look at the six](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=26) [principles of my PCM and the 14](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=29) [components of my system and for each of](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=32) [them each of the components I'm going to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=36) [try to give you multiple examples from](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=39) [My Vault](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=43) [also the drawing that I'm going to use](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=44) [in today's video I'm going to include a](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=48) [link in the video description to this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=51) [excalator drawing so you can open this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=54) [and you will find lots of additional](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=56) [information](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=58) [links to various videos that I've shared](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=59) [and links to blog posts and other](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=63) [materials so you can really dive into](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=65) [the topic that interests you the most](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=68) [just a quick reminder the visual](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=71) [thinking Workshop cohort for is starting](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=74) [this Saturday if you're interested to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=77) [learn more about visual thinking if you](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=81) [want to learn from me about organizing](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=83) [your information and obsidian this is an](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=86) [awesome opportunity to meet with me and](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=90) [to work together I'd love you to join](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=92) [cohort for](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=95) [so now let's dive in and let's start](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=97) [with the six principles](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=100) [so my first principle is to keep it](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=103) [simple](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=106) [each component each of the 14 components](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=107) [has a clear purpose and a single purpose](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=110) [and I try to keep these separate from](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=114) [one another so I don't get confused](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=117) [about it](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=120) [second I'm keen on minimizing friction I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=121) [use two primary tools for this templater](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=124) [and data view but of course there are](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=128) [some other automations as well but](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=131) [automation is an important part of my](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=134) [workflow](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=137) [third](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=138) [I live in the Brownfield reality and I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=139) [bet most of you also this means that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=143) [I've had previous PKM systems where I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=146) [stored information I had my file system](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=150) [so I've every time I upgrade my PC I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=153) [store the previous PCS content in a](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=157) [folder called archive so this is archive](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=161) [in an R Hive in an R Hive in an R Hive](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=164) [going back to the 1990s so there's lots](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=167) [of stuff](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=171) [also I use multiple tools like the brain](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=172) [Evernote ROM research Etc and I've](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=175) [imported materials from there but this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=179) [means that overall my volt is a mess I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=182) [try to get on top of the categories or](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=187) [tags or the folders but it is really](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=190) [hard with this Brownfield reality and I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=194) [decided to accept reality for what it is](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=197) [fourth I'm keen on avoiding moving files](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=201) [around I make this point because Thiago](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=205) [forte in building a second brain](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=207) [proposes a workflow where you move files](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=210) [into a folder for the project and when](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=213) [the project completes move your files to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=216) [somewhere else](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=219) [I don't like to move files around](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=220) [because then links break even in](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=222) [obsidian where you get some control](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=225) [around it there are some issues with](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=227) [moving files around so I place the file](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=230) [somewhere and I stick to that location](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=233) [even if it sometimes means that things](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=235) [don't end up in their correct folders](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=238) [fifth I apply latch latch stands for](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=242) [location alphabet time category and](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=246) [hierarchy and this was coined by Richard](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=249) [Warman he is the founder of TED talks](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=252) [and he said that everything in the world](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=255) [can be organized by these five means and](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=258) [by these five means only and the way I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=261) [apply latch or the reason I apply latch](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=264) [is to maximize the vase how I can find](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=267) [information so I can find information](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=271) [based on my calendar I can find the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=273) [information based on the physical](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=276) [location if it was force some reason](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=278) [memorable I can find it based on](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=281) [categories and with the other methods as](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=284) [well using latch and applying latch to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=288) [each pieces of information in my world](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=292) [helps me maximize findability and](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=294) [finally I always link now this is](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=298) [something that I've not been always](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=302) [deliberate on I looked at how many](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=304) [orphan files I have in my Vault and I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=307) [was surprised to see that it was in the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=309) [high hundreds meaning five six hundred](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=313) [orphan files and this is because often](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=316) [I'm using folders in a way that they](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=320) [provide a structure and often I just](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=324) [simply place a document with the topic](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=326) [in that file but of course that reduces](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=330) [findability so recently I've decided](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=333) [that I'm only going to place files in my](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=337) [vol if I'm able to link it to somewhere](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=340) [to My Graph so these are my principles](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=343) [and then let's dive into each of the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=346) [tools I'm going to start with folders](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=349) [and first of all you can see my folder](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=352) [hierarchy here](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=355) [it is](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=356) [a relatively lean folder hierarchy so](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=358) [you can see I have these are my folders](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=363) [there are some folders that I would love](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=365) [to get rid of but because I don't want](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=368) [to move files and because of the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=371) [Brownfield reality I cannot so archive](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=373) [the brain is there it has lots and lots](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=376) [of files where you can see there it has](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=379) [almost](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=382) [4500 files and the Thousand subfolders](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=383) [so that is a big mess but also Hobbies I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=386) [would love to move on their projects but](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=390) [again lots of files here lots of folders](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=393) [and I just decided to leave it there it](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=396) [is by the way I think of folders not as](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=400) [physical storage locations but as name](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=405) [spaces so let me show you what I mean by](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=409) [that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=411) [so when I create](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=412) [a new link to a file that doesn't exist](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=414) [in My Vault let's imagine I'm adding a](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=418) [new book to My Vault and I want to add](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=422) [the author I don't just write the name](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=426) [of the author for example Dan Rome but I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=429) [create the author in the people author's](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=433) [namespace which simply means that I type](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=437) [in and here in search we can actually](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=440) [take a look at this so I type in](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=442) [a link that starts with people then](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=447) [slash author and then slash I continue](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=450) [with the name of the author so in this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=453) [case you can see I have a number of](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=456) [ghost links so ghost link means that the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=459) [actual folder for the author has not](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=463) [been created so you can see here Dan](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=466) [Rome or Eliezer yutkovski you can see](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=469) [here a couple of Hungarian poets as well](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=471) [as some other authors](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=475) [by doing this then I create the file or](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=478) [when I create the link to the name of](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=482) [the person I can](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=485) [already give it a type I know it's an](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=487) [author even without creating the file](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=491) [and adding a tag author to me this is](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=494) [helpful](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=498) [second I like folders because they help](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=499) [me manage what gets synchronized with](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=502) [obsidian sync so here in obsidian sync](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=505) [settings you can actually](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=508) [specify exclude folders so here on my](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=511) [Mac I have nothing all my videos are on](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=515) [my desktop PC](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=520) [there I have lots of folders that are in](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=522) [the exclude because for example I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=525) [exclude all the folders with the video](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=528) [files and voice files because they are](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=531) [large and there's no point in](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=534) [synchronizing them however I keep them](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=536) [in obsidian but I can ring fence that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=539) [content and not move it around with](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=541) [obsidian sync](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=544) [and then](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=546) [I try to name YouTube Project files and](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=548) [other files as well or rather folders](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=553) [with a year month date naming this is](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=555) [something new that I've started so I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=561) [don't really have many examples of this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=563) [but here you will see that some of the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=566) [folders that are now created recently](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=570) [followed this naming convention what](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=573) [this helps me with is it gives me a](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=575) [chronological order for my videos](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=578) [because you can see I have whole bunch](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=581) [of files here and sometimes it is a bit](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=583) [of a difficult](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=585) [thing to find the video however I do](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=587) [remember the time when I created that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=591) [video](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=593) [and then in obsidian you can set up the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=595) [attachments folder and also the new file](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=598) [so here if I come to settings under](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=601) [files and links there are these](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=604) [additional settings that you can create](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=607) [so first of all the default location for](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=610) [new notes for me is the same folder as](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=613) [the current file which means that if I'm](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=617) [working on a topic and I just simply](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=619) [write the name of a new file not using](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=623) [the namespace then that file is going to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=626) [be created in the same folder if I want](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=630) [to place it somewhere else then I follow](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=633) [this namespace approach and I type out](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=636) [the location of the file](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=640) [and second I keep my attachments under](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=643) [the subfolder of the topic for me](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=647) [attachments and the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=650) [notes are very closely connected and](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=653) [this is why for me this makes sense so](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=657) [for example here if I come to input this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=660) [is where all my inputs are for example](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=663) [articles and assessments and books and](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=666) [conferences films if here's for example](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=669) [my book notes on deep work and you can](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=673) [see here that I have my attachments](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=677) [folder which includes all of my](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=680) [illustrations for deep work so that's](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=682) [about folders now moving on to tags I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=687) [only use one tag per page there's one](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=691) [exception to this which is more a](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=694) [stylistic thing and I didn't even](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=696) [include it here](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=699) [but you will see it in the next step](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=700) [when I talk about data View and how I'm](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=703) [using search so](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=707) [for now](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=710) [the point is I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=712) [aim to give a single tag to each](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=714) [document and that will give that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=717) [document a type so for example if we](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=720) [open this page and I'm going to navigate](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=724) [here](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=728) [if I open this page you can see that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=731) [this is a map of content and you can see](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=733) [I have my tag map of content here and](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=737) [now if I open xcoli Brain for this page](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=741) [then what you will see here is based on](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=745) [the tag on the page I'm going to give](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=749) [this file a different look and feel in X](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=752) [call your brain so all my map of](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=755) [contents are with this red color and](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=758) [have this icon of a map there all my](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=762) [people file so you can see couple of](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=766) [people here Thiago Fort and Nick Milo](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=769) [are they have this person at the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=771) [beginning all my books have this book](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=775) [there then I have ex College Road](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=777) [drawings have this painter's palette](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=781) [there](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=784) [Etc so I use the tag for the page to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=785) [also Define the look and feel of this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=789) [page in X color brain and just to show](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=792) [you how I configure this in excalib](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=796) [brain so here if I come to excalibrane](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=798) [settings I can scroll down here here are](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=801) [all the different tags listed that I'm](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=805) [using in My Vault with a special purpose](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=809) [and here if I choose one of the tags so](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=812) [let's look at the Moc that we looked at](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=816) [a second ago you can see that I have my](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=819) [prefix which is this map emoji and then](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=822) [I have the background color and the text](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=826) [color specified and I can see that this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=828) [is how these are going to look and for](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=831) [example if I look at a person then you](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=835) [can see that this is how a person node](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=838) [looks like in X color brain I need to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=841) [add these Stacks here and then they](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=844) [appear here in the list and finally on](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=846) [tags I have this article call and on the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=849) [link that I'm going to include in the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=853) [show notes that will take you to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=856) [excalator.com with this drawing there](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=858) [you will find this link and you can](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=861) [click on this so back in the time when I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=863) [was working in the brain I had this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=867) [whole](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=870) [color scheme of how I used the different](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=871) [thought types and these are actually the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=875) [equivalents of tags or the way I use](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=878) [them in obsidian and I had different](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=881) [color ranges so read the range were all](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=883) [the media that I consumed the yellow](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=888) [range was for example all the people](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=891) [friends family colleagues all these](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=894) [purple items were companies or legal](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=897) [entities](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=900) [Etc so each color had its own purpose](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=902) [and then I looked at my graph then I was](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=905) [able to understand it immediately or](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=909) [understand it much better](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=912) [so moving on talking about links so](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=914) [we're going to look back to my PKM Moc](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=917) [and you will see how I'm using links](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=921) [here so or the ontology so the ontology](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=924) [is defined here in the front by this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=928) [data view field with double columns](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=934) [after it and then I have the link the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=937) [way this is going to appear on the graph](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=941) [in X color brain is here if you take a](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=946) [look you will see that these tags that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=949) [are here on the left hand side appear](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=953) [here as related to examples](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=956) [example examples Etc author you have the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=960) [different type of relationship so I use](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=964) [ontology in My Vault](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=968) [and I use it to describe the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=971) [relationship between this file and the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=975) [next file to me this helps to think](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=977) [about why I have that link there it](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=981) [what's the purpose of the link actually](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=984) [coming up with the ontology is sometimes](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=987) [a challenge in ex call it brain there's](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=991) [a feature that I get prompted with these](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=994) [ontologies so if I type triple double](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=999) [colon then this list comes up and I can](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1003) [just simply type and we'll get all the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1008) [different type of ontologies I have](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1012) [defined and each of these has a](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1015) [definition index color brain whether](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1018) [they're a parent a child or a friend so](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1020) [again here in ex call it brain you can](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1024) [see that these are all the fields that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1027) [our parents or children and friends I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1030) [have some](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1034) [excluded ontologies of HR there for some](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1035) [other technical reasons and I have also](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1040) [a couple of](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1043) [unregistered ones that I either still](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1044) [need to register to make it explicit in](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1047) [X color brain or they're just there](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1050) [because over time these were created](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1053) [anyway so this trigger oh and let me](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1055) [just show you this so you can see here](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1058) [you have the ontology suggestor is](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1061) [something you can turn on and then using](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1064) [these features these hot combinations](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1067) [the suggestor comes up so if I only want](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1070) [to see friend relationships then these](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1074) [are all the type of ontologies I can](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1076) [apply here that will create a lateral](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1079) [Link in escalate brain for me](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1082) [so the lateral link just to show you](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1087) [that as well they'll look like this so](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1089) [everything here the central idea is the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1092) [document I have open and everything on](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1096) [the left hand side are lateral links](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1099) [these are parent](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1101) [links and these are children nodes so](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1102) [that's the logic and I use the ontology](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1106) [to specify where each item gets on my](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1109) [graph linking also](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1114) [includes embedding items into the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1117) [excalator storyboard so again let me](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1120) [just show you how this storyboard looks](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1123) [like so the document we are looking at](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1126) [right now so again I'm going to open](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1128) [excalibrane and now in the center you](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1131) [can see that this is the file we are](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1135) [looking at so this is mypkm design text](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1137) [links folder ontology Moc zettel custom](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1139) [Etc and you can see that all of these](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1143) [items that are embedded here are also](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1146) [present here so for example here I have](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1150) [this calendar icon that's embedded I'm](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1154) [not going to navigate to this because](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1158) [that will take us off on a tangent but](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1160) [you can see already that this icon is](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1164) [actually used in four other places so](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1167) [it's used in five places so already with](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1170) [this I'm making a connection to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1173) [somewhere else where I talk about time](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1176) [and calendaring](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1178) [Etc but so for me when I embed an object](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1180) [into my X call it raw storyboard for a](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1185) [topic then that already will create a](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1189) [link](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1193) [and on the ontology we already talked](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1195) [about the ontology bit so we are going](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1199) [to take this topic off as well the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1202) [ontology describes the relationship](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1205) [between notes and I differentiate](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1207) [between parent child and lateral](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1211) [connections I implemented with data view](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1213) [fields and I visualize it with](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1216) [excalibraine here's a video where I talk](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1218) [about this in more detail](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1221) [then the next important element of my](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1226) [organization system is I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1229) [work with atomic nodes and use](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1233) [transclusion so for example as just I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1236) [mentioned with the calendar item and](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1240) [maybe we can](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1242) [we can actually navigate to that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1244) [calendar to see where else we are using](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1246) [the calendar so by reusing or maybe](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1249) [here's the check mark and we're going to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1253) [navigate to this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1255) [by if I click here this will open the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1257) [check mark and here I can](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1261) [come to the various documents](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1265) [so for example evaluating evidence this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1270) [is actually a part of my book on a page](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1274) [for the book rationality so here I'm](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1278) [using exactly the same check mark and](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1282) [using the same check mark I can navigate](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1285) [to to the topic sometimes these links](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1288) [are](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1292) [irrelevant oftentimes this comes as an](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1293) [interesting surprise that yeah that that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1297) [visual link that I reuse](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1301) [also provides a contextual linking](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1304) [so that's about Atomic notes I also use](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1311) [this the construction of images there](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1315) [are two videos here I'm not going to go](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1318) [into this because this is a big rabbit](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1320) [hole that goes down into this hole how I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1323) [deconstruct excel drawings into sub](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1326) [drawings but this is a very important](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1329) [part of my whole methodology of reusing](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1332) [components not redrawing and using these](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1336) [components to create links but also](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1339) [I tried to do this by creating](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1343) [consistent sections in my other notes as](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1347) [well so here are two examples here's an](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1352) [example of an article and you will see](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1355) [that the article has a summary section](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1358) [and by the way if you look at my book](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1362) [notes then the book note also has a](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1366) [summary section by way of having this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1369) [commonality I know that if I'm](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1372) [referencing a book I can immediately](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1375) [write hashtag summary and just get the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1379) [summary embedded into the location so if](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1382) [I transclude this so let's say I open](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1385) [today's daily node and I want to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1389) [transclude building a second brain](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1392) [summary so then I would write](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1395) [building a second brain like this and I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1399) [would immediately write hashtag summary](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1405) [and with this I'm able to embed this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1408) [here and I would also probably add a](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1412) [reference here so in this case the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1416) [reason I'm putting this here is because](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1418) [this is an example so I would add my](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1420) [ontology like this but by having this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1424) [consistent approach of always calling](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1427) [the summary summary this just simplifies](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1431) [my life because with this consistency I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1434) [can easily embed items and reference](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1437) [them the same with quotes don't ask me](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1441) [why I ended up with P but every quote](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1444) [that I have so for example here's the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1448) [daily quote from today if I look here in](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1451) [markdown then you will see that here I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1456) [have this quote from Napoleon Hill and](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1459) [here I have this reference with p and](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1462) [again I know that if there's a quote a](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1466) [single quote in a file that is worth](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1470) [referencing then it's going to have a](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1474) [block reference p and that just helps me](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1477) [easily find these items in My Vault this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1480) [file this example book is a good example](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1485) [for Section headings](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1487) [so there is a trade-off between](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1489) [embedding files and in reference or or](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1492) [creating larger files so if I look at](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1497) [building a second brain you can see here](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1501) [that I have couple of notes here and](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1503) [these notes are just simply typed here](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1506) [so I'm I'm not embedding anything here](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1508) [in this case I made some notes about the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1512) [book some of my research as I was](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1516) [reading the book and here under notes I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1518) [simply added these items and that's all](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1521) [but for example if I would open another](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1524) [book I'm going to open for example](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1527) [emergence](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1530) [so if I open emergence then here you](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1534) [will see that I had a bit more content](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1537) [here and in this case](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1539) [I included or transcluded content here](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1541) [and some of them I only translated the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1547) [summary in other cases I transcluded the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1550) [whole material but in these cases the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1554) [files actually live in their proper](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1557) [location so this file lives here in its](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1561) [input folder under YouTube so this is](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1565) [the input YouTube folder that's where](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1568) [the file is and here it's a block](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1570) [reference so you can see this as a block](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1575) [reference so that's the trade-off if I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1578) [have lots of files or lots of notes that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1581) [I want to include then I start to break](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1585) [them out into their relevant files and I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1587) [make them embeds that have a link if I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1591) [don't have that many I typically start](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1595) [by typing these topics here](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1598) [and then break them out later if I feel](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1602) [that that is required so moving on let's](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1606) [move up to the top here](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1610) [so file names I have a couple of file](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1613) [name conventions which I find pretty](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1615) [helpful All My Mocs start with an](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1619) [underscore like you can see here so](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1623) [let's just to show you some of the other](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1626) [mocs if I come to call it brain and I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1628) [think with that we can also cover mlc so](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1633) [here these are the various map of](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1637) [contents in My Vault you can see these](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1640) [right here](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1644) [and you can see that each of them have](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1645) [the same file name but similarly I have](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1647) [naming conventions so for example](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1652) [book cover](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1655) [will bring up all the book covers I have](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1657) [in my Vault or if I type in](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1660) [logo then this will bring all the logo](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1664) [images if I type icon](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1667) [then it will show all the icons in My](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1671) [Vault I also use this I have some](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1675) [automations around it I'm going to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1678) [include that link here as well so here](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1680) [if I open the image Library so it's here](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1684) [I also have a local library so maybe](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1688) [let's open the local library then this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1690) [will](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1695) [show me all the logos in My Vault so all](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1696) [of these files will start with the word](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1700) [logo so there's my you can see my Apple](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1703) [logo here if I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1706) [press Ctrl o and type logo](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1708) [Apple logo then you can see that indeed](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1713) [that Apple logo is right there also in](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1716) [my naming convention you can see that at](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1719) [the end in this case and in most of the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1722) [cases my file name has three parts it](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1726) [specifies the type of file so is it the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1730) [book cover a logo an illustration a](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1733) [photo an icon a whatever then there's](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1735) [the actual keywords that Define the file](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1739) [so in this case it's Apple logo but for](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1742) [example if I open my image library then](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1745) [you will see that I have longer file](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1749) [names in my image Library so these are](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1751) [all the icons in My Vault and here you](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1754) [can see that you see the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1758) [headache frustration anger are the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1761) [keywords and then the final part of the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1764) [naming convention you will see here as](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1767) [well is the source of the file so in](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1770) [this case it's a flat icon but if the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1773) [source is something else then it's going](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1776) [to be that other source so these are the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1778) [various naming so you can see here book](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1782) [cover illustration thumbnail book on the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1784) [page starts with a bob literature note](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1787) [starts with Ln](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1791) [Etc and the date format I use is year](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1793) [year months month and day day because](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1798) [that consistent naming helps me find](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1801) [stuff easier](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1803) [then I use templates and I have lots of](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1805) [templates so here if I open my template](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1809) [folder](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1813) [template or templates so you can see I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1817) [have a whole bunch of templates I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1819) [actually follow again the naming](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1822) [convention here as well so I have](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1824) [templates that create a new line so it](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1826) [just creates a single line in the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1830) [document and I have templates that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1833) [create new pages and I have some other](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1836) [templates as well](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1839) [for many of the things I do I use these](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1841) [templates and then some of my templates](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1843) [actually automate the process of](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1846) [creating folders and multiple files so](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1850) [if there's a more complex activity then](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1854) [I use that so for example the YouTube](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1857) [workflow video that I explain here will](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1862) [show you a case study where I have a](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1866) [template that creates files](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1869) [and folders and places stuff all the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1872) [places and the excalator templates shows](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1875) [you different ways how you can create](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1878) [graphical templates](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1880) [maybe pre-filled templates for various](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1882) [tasks so templates are an important part](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1885) [of my setup](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1889) [they already talked about ontology and](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1891) [frankly we already looked at the maps of](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1895) [content as well here's another map of](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1900) [content just as an example so this is my](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1902) [map of content about sketchnoting again](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1907) [you can see here all the different](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1910) [ontologies and links you can see lots of](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1913) [material here so this is my map of](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1917) [content for sketchnoting and I have a](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1921) [good number of map of contents to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1924) [summarize various topics that I'm](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1926) [working on and some of these so for](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1929) [example here this map of content also](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1932) [has some visual summaries as well so for](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1935) [example this is a summary about some](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1939) [sketchnoting listing some sketch noters](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1944) [some YouTube channels some books and](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1947) [some stuff about visual vocabulary](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1950) [Etc then moving on](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1952) [the way I use daily notes is I use daily](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1955) [notes to create the time hierarchy based](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1959) [on latch so this is the time aspect and](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1964) [then we're going to talk about geotags](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1968) [and that's going to be the location](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1971) [aspect of organizing information so if](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1973) [we look at this holiday last year June](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1977) [we went to Rome with my wife](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1980) [what I want to show you here is here if](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1982) [I click to first I need to open here the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1985) [right hand side so we have the map here](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1989) [with all sorts of different locations](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1992) [and here if I open this to show this on](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1996) [the map then you can see that this has](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2000) [actually a location here and you can](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2003) [also see the other components of our](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2005) [visit the tickets to Vatican City and to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2008) [the Colosseum and then just going](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2013) [further on here here's earlier this year](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2015) [we went to Sicily and we visited the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2019) [Valley of the temples and the Turkish](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2023) [stairs as well as moved around here](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2026) [we've had to Aetna as well so here's the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2030) [family on Aetna and and so this is I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2033) [think a very useful way to organize](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2037) [information I'm using the map view](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2040) [plugin so this is the map view plugin](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2043) [right here this is the settings for that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2047) [I find this very practical you can add](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2050) [Geo tags so this is here a Geo tag if I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2053) [click here then you will see that this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2057) [is a geotag based actually in this case](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2060) [a lat long coordinates but this can also](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2063) [be an address depending on the type of](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2067) [Link we are talking about you can also](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2070) [see that I'm using the check-in checkout](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2073) [inline ontology here so the way this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2077) [looks in excalib brain and that's where](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2080) [we come back to the Daily note linkage](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2083) [so if now again I open xcoli Brain then](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2086) [you will see that our vacation in Rome](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2090) [is linked to these days so this is when](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2095) [we were in Rome you can also see we were](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2099) [in Vatican City and the colossum and you](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2102) [can see some other information here as](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2106) [well but the point is by adding check-in](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2108) [and checkout I can know when we arrived](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2112) [and when we left](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2117) [and by linking all of these events to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2119) [the Daily note](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2122) [through the daily note I can navigate my](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2124) [history and I can look at what happened](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2129) [on that day I'm not going to open the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2131) [daily note because that typically](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2133) [contains some personal information as](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2135) [well that I don't want to share but the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2138) [idea is these daily notes you can see](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2141) [here are linked to one another with the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2144) [tomorrow link and so this creates this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2146) [chain of days and each day I'm linking](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2150) [what is happening on that day maybe to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2154) [show you just one more example if we](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2157) [come to this page right here then](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2160) [this page is linked to today's date](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2164) [right there and this is when I'm working](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2169) [on it you can also see that this is](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2172) [linked to a couple of days ago as well](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2175) [and I also worked on this so I know on](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2178) [what which days I worked on this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2181) [specific material so that actually](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2184) [covers daily notes as my time hierarchy](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2187) [and geotags now I like to see tasks in](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2191) [the context where I need to talk about](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2197) [them in my normal work I have many](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2199) [projects happening in my organization](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2204) [and I deal with lots of people so in](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2207) [each situation I want to be reminded of](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2210) [the actions that we discussed with that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2214) [person or with that vendor or with that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2217) [project at the last time we met](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2220) [and I talk about this and how I do this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2223) [in it's about time so you can look at](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2226) [this video](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2229) [but I want to show you how this looks in](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2231) [my demo of all so this is going to be an](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2234) [example just to show you very quickly](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2237) [how this works so for example this is my](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2240) [note about Bob the Builder and the video](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2244) [I'm referencing goes into more details](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2246) [about this and walks you through how](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2249) [this works](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2252) [but you can see here that when I am on](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2253) [the page for Bob the Builder I'm](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2257) [immediately cognizant that there is a](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2259) [topic where I'm waiting for Bob actually](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2263) [it is related to project K and this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2265) [right here is a data view query it's an](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2269) [extremely simple data view query I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2272) [explain everything about it in the video](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2276) [the point I want to show you here is I'm](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2278) [placing this information](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2282) [on the page of the person and whenever](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2285) [I'm meeting with someone or talking](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2288) [about the project or whatever other](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2290) [topic I always open the page for that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2293) [person or project or topic and most of](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2296) [my templates or pretty much all of my](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2300) [templates include the task section](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2303) [therefore I always get the context](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2306) [relevant tasks in the context when I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2309) [need it at the time that I needed so for](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2313) [example you can see here there's an](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2316) [action for Bob on a meeting to discuss](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2319) [something with Mock and if I look at](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2322) [Mock's page of course I'm going to see](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2325) [all of these actions that are now for](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2328) [mock the dump truck and you will see](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2331) [that there's an action from the page](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2334) [about the Builder and then there's](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2336) [another action that was somehow](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2338) [discussed on rolly or vid Rowley the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2341) [steamroller and then something from](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2344) [Project B](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2347) [one quick side note that this is the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2348) [other way I'm using tags and I only use](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2351) [it in this specific instance so I have](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2354) [three tags I have the they think four](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2358) [discus with and promised too so these](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2362) [are three tags I use frankly](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2367) [I don't really search on them I could](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2371) [actually categorize the data view query](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2374) [here based on promise to discuss with](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2378) [waiting for and I had a period of time](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2380) [when I did that I recognized that it](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2383) [didn't really matter that much right now](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2386) [this is more for just stylistic reasons](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2389) [for me it is important to know that I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2393) [noted something down because I need to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2397) [talk about that with the person or that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2398) [person has promised me something and I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2402) [need to wait for that and follow it up](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2404) [or maybe I promise something to that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2406) [person and I need to be cognizant of](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2409) [that when we meet so I can either share](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2412) [the results with the person or be](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2415) [proactive in apologizing that I haven't](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2418) [yet done it but the point is that I want](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2421) [to be reminded so in this case I'm also](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2424) [using tags but here I'm not using it to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2427) [define the type of the page but I'm](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2431) [using it just as a stylistic component](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2434) [to remind me of the type of action that](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2438) [I'm talking about](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2443) [this is also then covering the dynamic](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2445) [list so tasks are in the context then](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2447) [where I need them and I use data view](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2451) [fields and then I'm using various](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2454) [Dynamic lists I'm using not only data](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2458) [view but I also have embedded obsidian](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2461) [queries as well and finally I have this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2465) [Diagnostics and maintenance page and](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2468) [here I'm looking at stuff like orphan](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2472) [notes which right now are the absolute](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2475) [orphans are files that are just there no](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2478) [one is pointing at them and it is not](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2481) [pointing to anyone so they are](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2484) [completely alone in the dark so I have](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2485) [109 at the moment of these and then for](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2489) [example I have this list of pasted](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2493) [images so I like to name the images](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2497) [either illustration or photo or whatever](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2500) [wherever they came from so sometimes I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2503) [come here and clean up some of the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2505) [pasted images that I didn't name so I](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2508) [have the properly named images](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2511) [so that summarizes how I organize](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2514) [information in obsidian it may be a lot](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2517) [but to me this structure helps put](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2520) [everything in place the key component](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2524) [here is latch making sure that I have](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2526) [multiple ways to find information either](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2530) [by location or alphabet time category or](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2533) [hierarchy and then you could see the](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2536) [different tools and components that I'm](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2539) [using to achieve this](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2541) [so that's all I wanted to share with you](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2544) [again just a quick reminder if you want](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2547) [to learn more if you're interested in](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2550) [exploring visual thinking and exploring](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2553) [the use of obsidian with me sign up to](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2557) [cohort for you still have a couple of](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2560) [days to do that I'm going to
