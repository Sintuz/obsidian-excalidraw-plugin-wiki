![Obsidian ExcaliBrain - Beta Release v0.0.1](https://youtu.be/rk3K4mlgOMM)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt introduces the beta release of the Obsidian Excalibrain plugin, which facilitates visual knowledge management within the Obsidian note-taking application. He explains the installation process, requirements, and various features of Excalibrain, including how it visualizes relationships between notes. Viewers are encouraged to download and try the plugin to enhance their workflow.

# Key Takeaways
- The Excalibrain plugin allows users to see relationships between notes graphically, including parents, children, friends, and distant relatives.
- Users can customize note relationships using data view fields and personalize the appearance of nodes based on tags or preferences.
- The plugin is available for manual installation and requires the latest versions of relevant plugins to function correctly.

Hey all, I just released the very first beta release of Obsidian Excalibrain. It's not yet available in the community plugin store; you will need to use either the TFT hackers brat plugin or you will need to download the files from GitHub and manually install them yourself. Either way, once you've installed the plugin, you can start it using the command palette action "Open Excalibrain."  [* ](https://youtu.be/rk3K4mlgOMM?t=0)

Excalibrain requires the latest version of Excalidraw to be installed, which is 1.6.27, and it also requires the Data View plugin to be installed. By default, Excalibrain will infer the relationships of the node at the center. You will see the node representing the page that's open on the side. Below the page or below this node, you will see the children of this node; these are pages that are referenced and linked in that page. [* ](https://youtu.be/rk3K4mlgOMM?t=3)

Above the page, you will see its parents, which are the pages that have a backlink to this page. On the side, you will see the friends, which are pages where there's a mutual reference between this page and that page. If you have the link from this page to that page on this page and from that page to this page on that page, then you have the distant relatives in the top right, which are the children of the parent nodes. [* ](https://youtu.be/rk3K4mlgOMM?t=9)

Now if you want to be deliberate about these relationships, that's when you can use data view fields. You simply add these data view fields like parents, or based on, or author, or source, or whatever names you like. You can add these data view fields to your document, and you can configure in settings which of these fields should be interpreted as a parent relationship, which should be interpreted as a child relationship, and which should be interpreted as a friend relationship. [* ](https://youtu.be/rk3K4mlgOMM?t=12)

You have different types of nodes. First of all, you have the base node type, which is as the name suggests, the base default node type that is displayed. You have the inferred nodes, which are the types of relationships that I've just explained earlier without using data view. Then you have the virtual nodes; virtual nodes are nodes that don't yet have a file createdâ€”it's referenced in your document, but there is no file that exists at this time. Then you have the attachment nodes, and as you can expect, those are attachments, i.e., not markdown documents referenced in your page. [* ](https://youtu.be/rk3K4mlgOMM?t=45)

You can show or hide these different types of nodes, as well as you can customize their display style using the drop-down list and then setting the styles in the plugin settings. Now, these settings work such that everything inherits from the base type, and you only need to set the difference to the base type. So, for example, if I want to change the font type of the central node, then all I need to do is I need to click the toggle button that I want to set a different font for the central node style, and with that, I've redefined my central node style, and it will have a handwritten font, like in the example that I show. [* ](https://youtu.be/rk3K4mlgOMM?t=48)

Also, you can set the style of notes based on tags that appear on the page. You will need to add the tag, including the hashtag, in a comma-separated list in the settings, and once the tag is added to the list, then in the drop-down list, you can choose that specific tag, and you can change the style as you wish. For example, you can add an emoji as a prefix to display that note differently, or you can even change the border color or shape or whatever about that note, so it stands out from the rest. [* ](https://youtu.be/rk3K4mlgOMM?t=155)

I hope as a result of watching this quick demonstration, you will go ahead and download the plugin and give it a try. Enjoy, thank you! [* ](https://youtu.be/rk3K4mlgOMM?t=372)
