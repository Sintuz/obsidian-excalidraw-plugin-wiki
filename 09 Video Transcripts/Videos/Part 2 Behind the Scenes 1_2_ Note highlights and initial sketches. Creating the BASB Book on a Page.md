![Part 2 Behind the Scenes 1/2: Note highlights and initial sketches. Creating the BASB Book on a Page](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0)

# Summary
In this video, the creator demonstrates how to transform literature notes into a visual summary using sketch notes inspired by Thiago Forte's book, "Building a Second Brain." The process involves highlighting key concepts, creating drawings, and adding icons to effectively represent the information. By the end, the creator has produced a cohesive book-on-a-page that encapsulates the main ideas from their reading experience.

# Key Takeaways
- The process of summarizing literature can be enhanced by combining text highlighting with visual sketching and icons.
- Utilizing tools like Excalidraw and flat icons can help in creating engaging and informative visual notes.
- Breaking down complex concepts into manageable, "intermediate packets" fosters better retention and understanding of the material.

# Content
Hey everyone, I just finished reading Thiago Forte's new book, *Building a Second Brain*, and I thought it would be an interesting demonstration, an interesting video if I took you through the process of converting my literature notes into highlighted notes, bold notes, and then creating a book-on-a-page summary using sketch notes. So what I'm going to do in this video is I'm going to open my literature notes, and I'm going to be going through that process of creating my highlights, creating my bold highlights, adding images and icons as I go through that process, and in the end, creating the book-on-a-page sketch note. As I'm going through the process, I'm going to stop here and there; there are going to be long stretches that I'm going to cut out because I don't think it's very interesting to look at me read through the literature notes and highlight text. But every once in a while, I'm going to stop and explain what's going on, and then hopefully by the end, I'm going to have a nice-looking summary on a page that will be the result of this summarization process. [* ](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=0)

So right at this point, at the very beginning, looking at these words that I highlighted, I immediately have some ideas of sketches that I would want to potentially add to my book-on-a-page. So I'm going to insert a quick drawing here, and let me first use the common palette to create a new drawing and embed it into the current active pane. So I'm going to create an X Color Draw drawing here, and I'm going to change this now to a white background. Let's open up Flat Icons and let's just look at some of the words. So there was some discussion about packaging information, sending it to my future self. There were some thoughts about writing down, and there was something about finding knowledge. So I have a couple of ideas that I would want to add. [* ](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=24)

So I’m thinking of a postal package—and so let's see if there's a postal package that I like here. I’m using Flat Icons; I find this an absolutely great place to look for various nice icons, and I actually like this package right there. So it’s really about packaging information, so I’m just going to paste this image in here for the time being. And then there was something about writing things down, so let's search for "writing." As you would expect, there are a number of different options here about writing. Well, I take notes on my computer, so I actually like this writing-on-a-computer image. So I'm going to copy this one into my drawing as well, and then there was something about the future, sending it to my future self. So let's search for "future." I like this; there are some nice icons here. I'm simply going to go with the very first one showing that it is moving to the future. Let me just add this icon as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=40)

And then there's something about information making it useful; so in formation, let’s see what comes up. I’m not happy with these icons, so what if I search for "knowledge"? Okay, so that’s more like it. I actually like this book with an idea in it, because that’s what I want to capture. I think that’s—I mean, there are many good icons here, but I'm going to go with this book with an idea. So let me paste this image here. And then the story goes something like this: for now I’m going to leave it at this point so maybe something about sending. Is there a good icon for sending? Yay, I like these paper airplanes. [* ](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=54)

So I’m going to choose—what are the colors here? I need to pay a bit of attention that it does not turn out to be too colorful. Maybe, in fact, I'm going to choose a black-and-white airplane here. I like the one that shows the speed as well. So let me just copy this one here as well, and so I think I have the core icons that I would want to use for the time being. I'm happy with this; I'll continue reading. But so you can see that these icons have now appeared. Okay, so there’s one thing you see—the airplane is missing, so let me come back here and I'm going to add X Color Draw export dark false because—so the reason the airplane doesn’t show on the black background is because these are PNG images that I'm downloading from Flat Icons, and the color is not inverted. So if I come back and refresh, then yes, it should be there. So I’ll continue reading and highlighting, and I'm not going to stop at every step adding images; I'm just going to now continue on reading, and as I do, I’m going to add icons as I think of them. I’ll come back to you at the end then I went through the entire document and I'm going to show you the different highlights and images that I added as my first pass through the material.

So I just finished highlighting my literature notes and adding some graphical representation. I just looked at all my recordings of this past period, and it took me four hours, which thinking about it is probably too much. And also, as I was doing the process, I realized that I was doing more than an intermediate packet; I was doing actually two activities at the same time, and reading some of the recommendations by Thiago, I should not really do this because it's not so efficient. Nonetheless, I think it was a very good experience going through the material and creating my quick sketches. So first of all, I think I did well on the amount of highlights. So for sure, I have quite a few highlights, and I think that my first couple of sketches are the type of sketches that I should have been doing all along. So these are really just a selection of the icons I might want to use and just drawing some simple diagrams, like here about the knowledge building blocks, and just explaining how you should think in Lego blocks or, as Tiago calls them, intermediate packets. [* ](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1407)

And you should be then thinking about constructing or assembling different products with your Lego blocks. Here as well, you can see the superpowers of the second brain in terms of making ideas more concrete, helping find new associations, expressing your perspective, and incubating ideas. So I think here this is all pretty nice. I have this slow burn, the simmering of ideas, which I very much believe in this concept of letting ideas work in your mind and collecting ideas as you go. At this point, when I got to the chapter about the CODE method, I think I went a bit too detailed. I do like the end result of my drawing, but this is already a bit more like the final sketch note that I want to make. However, I think this does nicely explain the idea of capture, organize, distill, and express, so I'm pretty happy with this. And then moving on, so here I also have a bit more highlights, and that's also because this part of the book was a bit newer or more interesting to me, so I wanted to capture more of this part. [* ](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1455)

Working through the details of the CODE method, I also created a couple of items. For example, this drawing about the creative process, that creativity and innovation doesn't happen by chance; it typically happens via a creative process. And you can see here I have Richard Feynman here with his 12 favorite problems and this small drawing representing that the new ideas, as I encounter new ideas, I filter them through my 12 favorite problems, which doesn’t need to be 12; it can be 10 or 15 or whatever, but a limited number of topics that interest me. And as I look at new information, I can put them in the right box in terms of safekeeping these ideas for later processing. And then, yeah, so here I have this idea about avoiding keeping too much and using this or creating this funnel of how I select what to keep: does it inspire me? Is it personal? Was it surprising? And is it something that’s useful? And based on that, I should capture small notes; Tiago's average is two notes per day over the past decade or so. So I think that’s the idea that overall, on the long term, the compounding benefits of capturing just one or two notes per day is already huge. [* ](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1691)

And then, so here’s the project box. This comes from Twyla Tharp, and this is where Thiago starts to introduce his perspective that you should organize based on actionability and not based on classification or based on the type of information. He introduces the PARA method, and I think on this drawing I spent far too much time. I should have done it quicker; on the other hand, I think this summary of PARA is quite nice. So this just gives you a workflow as well, or actually, Thiago writes down this workflow in his book: how to process new information and decide whether if it fits a project, then you should put it in a project folder. If it doesn’t fit a project, you should put it in your areas folder, and if it doesn't fit there, you put it in the resources and archives. Thiago uses this image of a kitchen where the projects you're working on are like the pots that are on your stove, and the areas that are important to you on the long term, like your finances, your family, etc., are like the fridge; there, you keep items close at hand. The resources are like presentation material or background material that you might use in the future or like items in your freezer that are stored for the longer term. Finally, you have your pantry, which is your archives. Maybe because this is the kitchen, the pantry is not bad; I would probably use the attic or the garage—at least in my case, the attic is where all the things that are archived are stored. But anyway, I like this idea of a kitchen, and going from the pantry to the stove is a nice way of expressing what goes in which order. [* ](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1804)

Moving on, yes, I have here—you can see all my highlights. I come to this idea of distilling the essence, and the point is I have an idea now: if I can package that idea and send it to my future self, then I'm going to be thankful for that. And I should think about what my future self will need. If I'm confident that this is such a great idea that I'll never forget, I'll probably end up forgetting it in the future. And here's the introduction of the progressing summarization. At the top, you can see Picasso's bull, and this is a nice example of simplification. There Picasso starts with the drawing of a bull, and first he adds additional detail, and then he starts to carve away detail. So you can see it like this, and in the end, he ends up with this simple representation, and that is the essence of distilling to the essence. And then moving on, what did I—what else did I create? So yeah, so here’s the whole idea of pruning the good to surface the great, so that was the part about the bull. [* ](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1885)

So here, about showing your work, I had a bit more high-level ideas. But the point is that your attention is a scarce resource, and that is why working in intermediate packets is a good idea because it can focus your attention on that small bit. It's also reusable as well, and a very important part of the creative process is sharing with others. The smaller the packets, the better you can share with others and get feedback. And when we are searching for information or inspiration in our second brain, then we can browse, we can search, we can use tags, and an important aspect is—or an important tool is serendipity, and you can amplify this by using visual patterns as well as you can amplify this by sharing your ideas with others. Because if you see others being surprised, that’s always an unpredictable response that you get; and when you share, you should tell the bigger story. And Thiago has this concept of everything is a remix. Overall, he suggests that we shouldn't be thinking of our job in terms of tasks, but we should rather think in terms of assets and building blocks that we are using and creating. [* ](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1981)

From here, you can see the big difference in this later part of the document compared to the beginning—that I started to condense my sketch notes into sketch notes per chapter. I think there's a benefit; I had this drawing open on the side, and I added items as I was highlighting in the chapter, so I think this is a good approach. On the other hand, as I look through the chapter, it's a bit harder to find where those ideas come from. Anyway, this part is about the creative execution, the idea of first divergence and then convergence, which also reflects or is reflected in the CODE method. Thiago gives three approaches: one approach is not to start with a blank sheet but rather start with items on your list and then connect those, build bridges. Then second, he recommends that you should finish the day of work by writing down your ideas for the next steps. Even better if you can already share your ideas, your intermediate packets, with others to capture feedback. Finally, the idea of dialing down—shipping something small instead of trying to ship something large—and the whole idea is if you’re thinking in Lego blocks or intermediate packets, then nothing gets lost. So the items that you scaled out of your final solution will make excellent intermediate packets, and you can reuse those elsewhere; maybe in a tweet or other communication material. [* ](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2076)

Then this final section is about the essential habits of digital organizers. Thiago talks about three habits: one is using the project checklist, and he talks about this knowledge flywheel and recommends doing a project kickoff and the project completion checklist. The project kickoff checklist starts with this broader set of questions, and then you move on to check your folders and tags, search for information, you drag and drop information into your project folder, and then you can start to create the outline of your new content—your remix—based on all of the pieces that you put together. Then Thiago recommends the weekly and monthly reviews; they have slightly different focuses. One thing Thiago mentions is during the weekly review—and not only here, elsewhere as well—he says try to keep your activity as small as possible. So when you’re sorting items in your inbox, don't try to highlight, don't try to summarize, don't try to understand and absorb; just focus on sorting the information, and you can return to this later when you have a project you need this information, and you’ll have the energy to dive deeper. The noticing habits is about the habit of noticing when something relevant, something interesting, something that resonates comes up, and you should take this opportunistic approach to capturing information and organizing clutter. This reminded me of Richard Feynman’s 12 favorite questions and the sorting process, as well as Thiago just again underlines the need to avoid this heavy lift type of approach. Instead, you should think of your work as a staircase with small steps, and you need to always notice that there’s a next step that you can take. So this is where I got so far. The next piece is going to be about compiling these bits and pieces into a book-on-a-page, so that’s where I’m going to continue next. [* ](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2247)

my](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=185) [drawing as well and then there was](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=187) [something about the future sending it to](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=190) [my future self so let's search for](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=192) [future so i like this there are some](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=195) [nice icons here](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=197) [i'm simply going to go with the very](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=200) [first one showing that it is moving to](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=202) [the future let me just add this icon as](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=205) [well](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=208) [and then there's something about](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=209) [information making it useful so in](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=212) [formation let's see what comes up](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=216) [i'm not happy with these icons so what](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=223) [if i search for knowledge](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=225) [okay so that's more like it i actually](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=228) [like this book with an idea in it](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=231) [because that's what i want to capture](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=233) [i think that's i mean there are many](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=238) [many good icons here but i'm going to go](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=240) [with this book with an idea](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=242) [so let me](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=245) [paste this image here](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=247) [and then](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=249) [the the the story goes something like](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=251) [this](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=254) [that](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=255) [and for now i'm going to leave it at](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=257) [this point so](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=259) [maybe something about sending is there a](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=262) [good icon for sending](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=265) [yay i like these paper airplanes](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=269) [so](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=271) [i'm going to choose what are the colors](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=274) [here](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=276) [so it i i need to pay a bit of attention](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=277) [that it does not turn out to be too](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=280) [colorful maybe in fact i'm going to](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=282) [choose a black and white airplane here i](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=285) [like the one that shows the speed as](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=288) [well so let me just copy this one here](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=290) [as well](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=293) [and](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=296) [so i think](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=297) [i think i have](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=298) [the core icons](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=300) [that i would want to use for the time](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=302) [being i'm happy with this i'll continue](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=305) [reading but so you can see that these](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=307) [icons have now appeared okay so there's](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=309) [one thing you see the airplane is](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=312) [missing so](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=314) [let me come back here and i'm going to](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=315) [add](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=319) [x colored raw](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=320) [export](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=322) [dark](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=324) [false because so the reason the airplane](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=326) [doesn't show on the black background is](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=329) [because these are png images that i'm](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=331) [downloading from flat icon and the color](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=334) [is not inverted](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=338) [so](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=341) [if i come back and refresh then yes it](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=342) [should be there so i'll continue reading](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=345) [and highlighting and i'm not going to](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=348) [stop at every step adding images i'm](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=351) [just going to now continue on reading](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=354) [and as i do i'm going to add icons as i](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=356) [think of them i'll come back to you at](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=360) [the end then i vent through the entire](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=362) [document and i'm going to show you the](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=365) [different](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=367) [highlights and images that i

some](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1409) [graphical representation i just looked](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1412) [at all my recordings of this past period](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1414) [and it took me four hours which thinking](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1418) [about it is probably too much and also](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1421) [as i was doing the process i realized](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1424) [that i was doing more than an](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1427) [intermediate packet](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1431) [i was doing actually two activities at](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1432) [the same time and reading some of the](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1435) [recommendations by thiago i should not](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1438) [really do this because it's not it's not](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1441) [so efficient](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1443) [nonetheless i think it was a very good](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1445) [experience going through the material](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1447) [and creating my quick sketches so first](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1450) [of all i think](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1454) [i did well on the amount of highlights](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1455) [so for sure](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1458) [i have](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1460) [quite a few highlights and i think that](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1461) [my first couple of sketches](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1464) [are the type of sketches that i should](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1466) [have been doing all along so these are](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1468) [really just](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1471) [selection of the icons i might want to](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1472) [use and just drawing some simple](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1475) [diagrams like here about the knowledge](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1478) [building blocks](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1481) [and just explaining how you should think](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1482) [in](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1486) [lego blocks or as tiago calls them](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1487) [intermediate packets](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1489) [and you should be then thinking about](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1492) [constructing or assembling different](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1494) [products with your lego blocks](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1497) [here as well you can see the super](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1500) [powers of the second brain in terms of](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1502) [making ideas more concrete helping find](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1505) [new associations](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1508) [expressing your perspective and](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1511) [incubating ideas so i think here this is](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1513) [all pretty nice i have this slow burn](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1517) [the simmering of ideas which i i very](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1521) [much believe in this concept of letting](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1524) [ideas work in your mind and collecting](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1528) [ideas as you go](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1531) [at this point when](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1534) [i got to the chapter about the code](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1536) [method i think i went a bit](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1539) [too detailed i do like the end result of](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1544) [my drawing but this is already a bit](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1547) [more like the final sketch note that i](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1550) [want to make](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1553) [however i think this does nicely explain](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1554) [the idea of capture organized distill](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1557) [and express so i'm pretty happy with](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1560) [this](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1563) [and then](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1564) [moving on so here i i also have a bit](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1568) [more](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1572) [highlights and that's also because this](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1573) [part of the book was a bit newer or more](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1576) [interesting to me so i wanted to capture](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1579) [more of this part and then working](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1582) [through the details of the code method i](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1586) [also created couple of items for example](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1590) [this drawing about the creative process](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1594) [that](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1597) [creativity and innovation doesn't happen](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1598) [by chance it typically happens via a](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1601) [creative process](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1604) [and](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1607) [you can see here i have richard feyman](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1608) [here](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1611) [with his 12 favorite problems and](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1612) [this](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1616) [small](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1617) [drawing representing that the new ideas](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1618) [as i encounter new ideas i filter them](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1621) [through my 12 favorite problems which](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1624) [doesn't need to be 12 it can be 10 or 15](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1627) [or whatever but a limited number of](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1630) [topics that interest me and as i look at](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1633) [new information i can put them in the](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1636) [right box](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1639) [in terms of safekeeping these ideas for](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1640) [later processing](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1643) [and then](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1646) [yeah so here i have this idea about](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1647) [avoiding to keeping too much and using](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1652) [this or creating this funnel](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1655) [of how i select what to keep does it](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1658) [inspire me is it personal](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1661) [was it surprising and is it something](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1664) [that's useful and based on that](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1666) [i should capture](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1669) [small notes tiago's average is two notes](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1671) [per day over the past decade or so so](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1675) [i think that's the idea that overall on](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1678) [the long term the compounding benefits](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1681) [of capturing just one or two notes per](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1684) [day is already huge](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1687) [and then](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1689) [so here's the project box this this](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1691) [comes from twyla tharp and this is where](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1693) [thiago starts to introduce his](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1696) [perspective that you should organize](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1699) [based on actionability and not based on](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1701) [classification or or based on the type](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1705) [of information and he introduces the](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1708) [para method and i think on this drawing](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1712) [i spent far too much time i i should](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1716) [have done it quicker on the other hand i](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1719) [think this summary of para is quite nice](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1721) [so this just gives you a workflow as](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1726) [well or actually thiago writes down this](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1729) [workflow in his book how to process new](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1732) [information and decide whether if it](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1736) [fits a project then you should put it in](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1738) [a project folder if it doesn't fit a](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1740) [project you should put it in your areas](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1742) [folder and if it doesn't fit there you](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1745) [put it in the resources and archives and](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1748) [thiago uses this image of a kitchen](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1751) [where the projects you're working on are](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1754) [like the pots that are on your stove the](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1756) [areas that are important to you on the](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1760) [long term like your finances your family](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1763) [etc](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1766) [or like the fridge there you keep items](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1767) [close at hand](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1771) [the resources](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1773) [like presentation material or background](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1774) [material that you might use in the](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1778) [future](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1780) [or like items in your freezer that are](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1781) [stored for longer term and finally you](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1784) [have your pantry which is your r hives](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1787) [maybe because this is the kitchen the](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1791) [pantry is not bad i would probably use](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1793) [the attic or the garage at least in my](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1796) [case the attic is where all the things](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1799) [that are archived are stored but anyway](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1802) [i like this idea of a kitchen and going](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1804) [from the pantry](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1807) [to the stove is a nice way of expressing](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1808) [what goes in which water and then moving](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1812) [on](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1815) [yes i have here](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1816) [you can see all my highlights i come to](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1819) [this idea of distilling the essence](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1822) [and the point is i have an idea now if i](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1825) [can package that idea and send it to my](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1828) [future self](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1831) [then i'm going to be thankful for that](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1833) [and i should think about what my future](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1836) [self will need](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1839) [if i'm confident that this is such a](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1841) [great idea that i'll never forget i'll](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1843) [probably end up forgetting it in the](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1846) [future](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1848) [and here's the](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1850) [introduction of the progressing](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1852) [summarization and the top you can see](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1854) [picasso's](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1858) [bull and this is a nice example of](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1859) [simplification there picasso starts with](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1862) [the drawing of a bull and first he adds](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1866) [additional detail and then he starts to](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1869) [carve away detail](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1872) [so you can see it like this and in the](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1873) [end he ends up with this simple](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1876) [representation and that is the essence](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1878) [of distilling to the essence and then](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1882) [moving on what did i what else did i](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1885) [create so](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1888) [yeah so here's the whole idea of](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1890) [pruning the good to surface the crate so](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1893) [that was the part about the bull](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1896) [so here about showing your work i had a](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1899) [bit more high level](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1903) [ideas but the point](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1905) [is that your attention is a scarce](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1907) [resource and that is why working in](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1911) [intermediate packets is a good idea](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1914) [because it can focus your attention on](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1916) [that small bit it's also reusable](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1919) [as well as a very important part of the](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1922) [creative process is sharing with others](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1925) [and the smaller the packets the better](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1928) [you can share with others and get](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1931) [feedback and we can when we are](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1933) [searching for information or inspiration](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1936) [in our second brain then we can browse](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1940) [we can search we can use tags and](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1943) [an important aspect is](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1946) [or an important tool is serendipity and](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1948) [you can amplify this by using visual](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1952) [patterns](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1956) [as well as you can amplify this by](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1957) [sharing your ideas with others because](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1960) [if you see others being](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1962) [surprised that's always an unpredictable](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1965) [response that you get and when you share](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1968) [you should tell the bigger story and](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1971) [thiago has this concept of everything is](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1975) [a remix](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1978) [and overall](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1979) [he suggests that we shouldn't be](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1981) [thinking of our job in terms of tasks](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1983) [but we should rather think in terms of](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1986) [assets and building blocks that we are](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1989) [using and creating](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1991) [and](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1994) [from here](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1995) [so you can see the the big difference in](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1997) [in this later part of the document](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=1999) [compared to the beginning that i started](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2002) [to condense my sketch notes into sketch](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2004) [notes per chapter](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2008) [and i think there's a benefit i](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2010) [had this drawing open on the side and i](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2013) [added items as i was highlighting in the](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2016) [chapter so i think this is a good](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2019) [approach on the other hand as i look](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2021) [through the chapter it's a bit harder to](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2024) [find where those ideas come from](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2026) [anyway this part is about the creative](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2029) [execution the idea of first divergence](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2032) [and then convergence](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2036) [which also reflects or is reflected in](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2038) [the code method and thiago gives three](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2040) [approaches one approach is not to start](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2044) [with a blank sheet but rather start with](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2047) [items on your list and then connect](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2050) [those build bridges then second he](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2054) [recommends that](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2057) [you should finish the day](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2059) [of work by writing down your ideas for](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2061) [the next steps](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2064) [and](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2066) [even better if you can already share](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2067) [your ideas your intermediate packets](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2069) [with others to capture feedback and](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2072) [finally the idea of dialing down so](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2076) [shipping something small](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2080) [instead of trying to ship something](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2083) [large and the whole idea is if you're](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2085) [thinking in lego blocks or intermediate](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2087) [packets then nothing gets lost so the](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2090) [items that you scaled out of your final](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2092) [solution will make excellent](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2096) [intermediate packets and you can reuse](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2099) [those elsewhere maybe in a tweet or](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2101) [other communication material](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2104) [and then this final section is about the](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2107) [essential habits of digital organizers](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2110) [thiago talks about three habits](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2113) [one is using the project checklist and](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2116) [he talks about this knowledge flywheel](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2118) [and recommends doing a project kickoff](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2122) [and the project completion checklist](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2124) [and the project kickoff checklist](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2127) [is it starts with](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2130) [this broader set of questions and then](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2132) [you move on to](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2135) [check your folders and tags search for](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2137) [information you drag and drop](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2139) [information into your project folder and](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2143) [then you can start to create the outline](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2145) [of your new content your remix based on](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2149) [all of the pieces that you put together](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2153) [then thiago recommends](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2156) [the weekly and monthly reviews they have](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2158) [slightly different focuses and one thing](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2161) [thiago mentions is during the weekly](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2164) [review](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2166) [and and not only here elsewhere as well](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2167) [he says try to keep your activity to](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2170) [as small](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2174) [to be as small as possible so when](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2176) [you're](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2179) [sorting items in your inbox don't try to](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2180) [highlight don't try to summarize don't](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2183) [try to understand and absorb just focus](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2185) [on sorting the information and you can](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2188) [return to this later when you have a](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2192) [project you need this information and](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2195) [you'll have the energy to dive deeper](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2197) [the noticing habits](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2201) [is about the habit of noticing when](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2204) [something](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2207) [relevant something interesting something](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2208) [that resonates comes up and you should](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2210) [take this opportunistic approach to](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2214) [capturing information and to organize](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2217) [clutter and this reminded me of richard](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2219) [feyman's 12 favorite questions and the](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2223) [sorting process as well as thiago just](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2226) [again underlines](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2229) [the need to avoid](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2231) [this heavy lift type of approach instead](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2234) [you should think of your work as a](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2237) [staircase with small steps and you need](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2240) [to always notice that there's a next](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2242) [step that you can take](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2245) [so this is where i got so far](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2247) [the next piece is going to be](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2250) [about](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2252) [compiling these bits and pieces into a](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2253) [book on a page so that's where i'm going](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2256) [to continue next](https://youtu.be/KTsw020KFf0?t=2259)
