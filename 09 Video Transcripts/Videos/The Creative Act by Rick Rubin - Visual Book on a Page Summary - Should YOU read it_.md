![The Creative Act by Rick Rubin - Visual Book on a Page Summary - Should YOU read it?](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt shares his thoughts on Rick Rubin's book, "The Creative Act," presenting a critical analysis of its content and structure. He explains how he created illustrations for each chapter while expressing dissatisfaction with the book's organization and some of its themes. Despite his criticisms, Zsolt emphasizes the importance of creativity and the collaborative nature of the creative process.

# Key Takeaways
- Rick Rubin's "The Creative Act" is presented as a collection of meditations on creativity rather than a structured guide.
- The creative process involves planting seeds of ideas, experimenting with them, and eventually crafting and completing works, all while being mindful of the timeliness of inspiration.
- Creation is inherently collaborative, and sharing work allows others to build upon and reinterpret creative efforts.

# Content
Hey everyone, it's Zsolt here. So, I'm spending my holiday in the Alps, my favorite location, and as I have some free time on my hands, I'm also finishing up my book-on-a-page summary for Rick Rubin's "The Creative Act." This is the book that we were working on in cohort 9 of the visual thinking workshop, but I wasn't quite satisfied with the book-on-a-page summary that I created, so I wanted to work on it a little bit further now. [* ](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=0)

There are two things I utterly dislike about Rick's book, and let me just start with a bit of a rant. First of all, the book is disorganized; it lacks almost any structure. It's more like 78 meditations on the topic of creativity, some of them conflicting with each other. It's definitely not placed in any logical order, or at least I wasn't able to decipher it, and overall, for this reason, it is pretty hard to read. [* ](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=22)

The other thing that I dislike about it‚Äîbut that's just me personally‚Äîis the reference to the universe talking to us. This is something I get completely turned off by. In my mind, humanity over the ages has always used the words 'the universe,' or 'the stars,' or 'the gods' talking to us when we have no idea what's happening. So my takeaway is likely that Rick doesn't quite have an idea of what he's talking about, but for sure he has worked with many artists, so I think his meditations are of interest. [* ](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=39)

The approach we took in cohort 9 was to create an illustration for each chapter of the book. Now, this was pretty strenuous, and I don't recommend a similar approach in the future because some of the chapters are really small. This meant lots of illustrations, but on the other hand, it was a nice way to meditate on each chapter, and it was also a nice challenge to create these illustrations. Because the book is sort of a meditation book, I thought that the background of Tibetan prayer flags would be nice for the collection of my literature notes. So in the end, my literature notes ended up being individual cards on this flag or on this picture of Tibetan flags. [* ](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=75)

Now, after I've read the book, I created a concept map of "The Creative Act," trying to define what Rick means by being creative or by the term 'the creative act,' and that was the basis of my book-on-a-page summary. In the end, I divided the book into these parts. First of all, there's this overall statement from Rick that everyone is a creator, and it's not about a particular form of art. You can be a creator even at home as you cook your dinner; that can also be creative. [* ](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=117)

Then, Rick goes on to talk about the source‚ÄîThe Source being all the inspirations, all the ideas, and all the possibilities out there that we need to tune into and notice. This noticing is what he refers to as our filter and our personality, but also the things we listen to, the input we take, how we curate what we listen to, what we watch, what we read, and what we think. These are all going to influence what we pick out from the infinite amount of information around us. [* ](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=223)

And what Rick urges us to do is not to look for the one big idea, but rather as we filter out inspirations, create or plant these seeds. Plant many of these seeds because you never know; a seed might look very promising, but in the end, nothing might come of it. Another seed might look sort of pale, and in the end, it grows into a beautiful flower or tree. Rick continues that once you have your seeds planted, then you should be gardening them, and gardening means experimenting‚Äîtrying different things out, trying the opposite of what others are doing or what you've been doing previously. It is about playing like a child with your ideas and expecting surprise to happen. [* ](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=267)

Once you play with your ideas and the seeds, some of them will start to develop. When you see a promising seed, that is the time to move on from the experimentation gardening role to more of the crafting role. Crafting can be tedious; during crafting, you're going to be spending lots of hours with your work, and it even might take years to craft something. Crafting involves skills and lots of work, but what you need to pay attention to, according to Rick, is not to get stuck in crafting; you should move on to finishing your work. He calls this completion, and he talks about different ways of moving on to completion. The basic idea he mentions, and I think it's a very good idea, is that there are two things you need to pay attention to. [* ](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=375)

First, ideas are timely; in a period of your life, this means that the idea might be important to you today. If you spend too much time crafting it, by the end, the inspiration is gone, and the idea will no longer be so interesting to you. So, you should be finishing your craft before it gets stale. The second point he mentions is that unless you finish something, you cannot release it. This means you cannot start to work on something else, but it also means that others cannot build on your idea. This is where Rick takes the book in the next part: creation is a collaborative effort. [* ](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=413)

It's collaborative in the sense that your audience is going to make up their minds about what you‚Äôve created, and often the audience has a better understanding of what was created than the creator. But also, it means that other artists will work off of what you‚Äôve created, and this is okay‚Äîor actually, it‚Äôs more than okay. This is the whole virtuous cycle of creation: you build on what others have done, you put in your own personal perspective. He uses this illustration of a prism; that's light that comes through you. What you observe, that's the incoming light, and then your personality is going to refract it, and it's going to be a personal outcome. [* ](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=469)

In the end, the whole idea of creation is to share with others, and the closing thoughts I take away from Rick's book are two thoughts. First, that the whole objective of creating is for you to feel successful, for you to feel fulfilled, whether it makes financial success or whether others like it or not really comes secondary. You should look for fulfillment internally. The other takeaway is that there are many myths about how creative people, especially well-known creative people, work, and there are all sorts of methodologies built on them. Frankly, they don‚Äôt even know, and all of these myths are usually exaggerations. [* ](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=543)

So, that's my book-on-a-page summary of Rick Rubin's "The Creative Act," and this is my holiday in the Alps. I hope you like the book-on-a-page summary, and I also hope you like this video.

In this video, I summarize and reflect on Rick Rubin's new book, "The Creative Act," while enjoying my holiday in the Alps. I'll share my insights from Cohort 9 of the Visual Thinking Workshop, where we explored the book through illustrations. Despite finding the book disorganized and occasionally off-putting with its references to "the universe," I delve into its core ideas about creativity. Rubin emphasizes that everyone is a creator, and creativity isn't confined to traditional art forms. He talks about "The Source" of inspiration, the importance of filtering and curating ideas, planting creative seeds, experimenting, crafting, and ultimately completing and sharing one's work. Join me as I discuss these themes and my own takeaways from Rubin's meditations on creativity.

collection](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=157) [of my literature notes so in the end my](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=160) [literature notes ended up to be](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=163) [individual cards on this flag or on this](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=166) [picture of tiban](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=170) [flags now after I've read the book they](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=172) [created a concept map of the creative](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=176) [act trying to Define what Rick means by](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=180) [being creative or by the term the](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=184) [creative act and that was the basis of](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=188) [my book on a p summary in the end I](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=191) [divided the book into these parts so](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=195) [first of all there's this overall](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=198) [statement from Rick that everyone is a](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=201) [Creator and it's not about a particular](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=203) [form of art you can be a Creator even at](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=207) [home as you cook your dinner that can](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=211) [also be creative and then RI goes on to](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=214) [talk about the source The Source being](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=218) [all The Inspirations all the ideas all](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=223) [the possibilities out there that we need](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=226) [to tune into and notice and this](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=229) [noticing is what he refers to as our](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=233) [filter and our personality but also the](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=237) [things we listen to the input we take](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=241) [how we curate what we listen to what

is](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=486) [to share with others and the closing](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=490) [thought that I take away from rig's book](https://youtu.be/0JtabqjAqaU?t=493) [are
