![Explaining Links, Transclusions and Embedding in Obsidian Excalidraw](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt explains the concepts of linking, transclusion, and embedding within Obsidian Excalidraw, addressing common confusions around these topics. He clarifies how these functionalities operate differently, particularly emphasizing that transclusion is the primary method used in Obsidian to reference content from other files. By providing practical examples and distinct definitions, he aims to enhance viewers' understanding of how to effectively utilize these features in their knowledge management systems.

# Key Takeaways
- **Linking:** In Obsidian, links can be created to reference resources within the vault, from the web, or from local storage, using various types such as Markdown and Wiki links.
- **Transclusion vs. Embedding:** Transclusion involves referencing a part of another file or object, which appears as if it’s part of the current file but is not physically included, while embedding would imply storing a copy, which Obsidian discourages for efficiency.
- **Types of Transclusions:** Zsolt discusses static and interactive transclusions, explaining how images and documents can be referenced and manipulated within Excalidraw, enhancing the flexibility and organization of visual notes.

# Content
Hey everyone, Zsolt here. I wanted to spend a few minutes talking about linking, transclusion, and embedding. This topic came up at the office hours in cohort 9 last week, and we ended up talking about these topics for almost an hour. My takeaway from all of this was that obviously, this is confusing to people, and I could do a better job at explaining what Excalidraw can and cannot do. So in this video, I'll try to walk you through some of the basic concepts, and hopefully by the end, you will have a much better understanding of the difference between these terms and what Excalidraw can and cannot do in Obsidian. So let's dive in. We are going to explore these three topics, and I also have a table with a number of examples that we are going to go through, so hopefully, this will be all clear. [* ](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM)

On this opening page, what you can see here is I have a web page. Of course, I can embed web pages. I have this image of a document here. I have this Markdown document from my vault that I can edit and move. This document, I also have a YouTube video embedded here, as well as I have this animated GIF, and of course, I could have many other things, but let's start to dive in here and first talk about the easy stuff. So what are the different types of objects you can embed into Excalidraw? You can embed images, and images can be either Excalidraw images or other image formats like PNG, SVG, etc. They can be Markdown documents, and there are actually two different ways of embedding Markdown, which we’ll look at. You can embed video from within the vault and from outside the vault. You can embed web pages, and of course, you can embed links to other files, but those links will just be links. When you click on it, either the Obsidian built-in feature will function, or you will be prompted to go outside Obsidian and use the default tool on your device. Also, the easy part of the discussion is from where you can embed. Well, you can embed from the Obsidian vault. Frankly, this is my primary approach. My mindset with Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) is that I'm building a system for the next decades, not just a couple of years. I still use notes from 30 years ago, and for me, linking to images on the web or linking to stuff on my drive outside of Obsidian is sort of meaningless because it defeats the purpose. Of course, I do link to YouTube videos, but otherwise, I try to keep everything in my vault so it's in one place, easy to handle and manage. However, you can also link to files on your local drive, as well as to resources on the web. [* ](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM)

Now let's come to the harder part: What does linking mean, what does transclusion mean, and what does embedding mean? So let's go through these one by one. I think the easiest is linking. A link is simply a reference to a resource you know about—hyperlinks, wiki links, and Markdown links are types of links you can create in Obsidian and specifically in Excalidraw. In this case, there are two different types of links, and I'm going to show you examples in just a moment. So now, we’re just talking about getting the big picture. You can create links by typing the text, the link text in a text element, and then it's a text element link, or you can add links to any object in Excalidraw, and then it becomes an element link. In the top corner, you have this icon, which is the link indicator, and then you know you have a link there. You can click it, and you can navigate. [* ](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM)

I think transclusion is where people start to feel uncertain. What the heck does transclusion mean, and why am I using the word transclusion instead of embedding? Does it mean the same thing or something different? Transclusion is when you embed or include part of an image or part of a document or part of something. You reference a part of something in another document. You don't embed it; you only have a reference. It will appear as if it's there, but the file or the content is not there; it's only a reference to that file or to the part of the file that you want to show. This is what Excalidraw and Obsidian do for most parts, or practically all the time. I don't embed the objects you create or the images you add to Excalidraw; they are not in the Excalidraw file. They are always transcluded from somewhere within your vault. Now, there are some differences here that might make this a bit more confusing. So you can have two types of transclusions: you can have interactive transclusions, and these are called embeddables. An example would be a YouTube video or a web page. The examples I showed in the beginning are interactive transclusions that are called embeddables. Sometimes they are also called iframes, though I'm trying to get rid of that terminology and use the word embeddable consistently. Those are the interactive transclusions, and then you have static transclusions—for example, these images like this TV set here with the infinite cycle of TV images nested into one another—that's a set of static transcluded images of icons. Or this is a transclusion here as well: a static image that you can see the keyhole with an image behind the keyhole. So that's the static transclusion when you embed, and again I'm using this word, and you'll see why I'm mixing up transclusion and embed. Static transclusion is when you place an image and display it in Excalidraw, and it doesn't move; you cannot interact with it. Finally, you have nesting, which is really a static transclusion. The reason I talk about nesting separately is that one special feature of Excalidraw in Obsidian is that you can deconstruct or decompose parts of an image, and I'll show you that in a moment. You can do that several layers deep; you can sort of create Excalidraw pieces as a set of Lego pieces that you build into components and then work with those components as a higher-level Lego piece; you can build up images several layers deep. [* ](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM)

Now let's move to the final concept here, which is embedding. By the dictionary, embedding means saving a copy of an object within another file. In this case, when you embed, you can actually delete the original object and everything will be contained in the place where you embedded it. On Excalidraw.com, when you place an image—when you copy an image on Excalidraw.com—the file that image is going to be embedded in Excalidraw. The same goes here: if I export this page as an Excalidraw file, then the images are going to be embedded. In that case, the file is fully self-contained with all the pieces; however, that's also true for images when you export to any image format. This only really is meaningful when you export SVG files because PNGs are just bitmaps. So that's embedding. Now, in Obsidian Excalidraw, this is practically not supported, and it's not supported for a reason. The reason is that Excalidraw files are Markdown files, and when you embed images, images are typically large files. I can embed images; there are ways of encoding image files that they can be placed in Markdown files, but the Markdown files become big, and Obsidian’s indexing engine is not designed to handle super large files. For this reason, and also from a PKM perspective, from a linking and thinking perspective, it's counterproductive to embed images because that will limit the reusability. Instead, I have the image object or the video object, and I keep it separate from the drawing; it is only a transcluded reference in the image. But as I mentioned, embedding is the default behavior on Excalidraw.com. Now you can hopefully start to understand why I'm confused about these terms because essentially in Excalidraw for Obsidian, transclusion is equal to embedding or I can use the terms interchangeably because there is no real difference. You can see here that embedding is pretty much not supported—only for image types and only when you export to the Excalidraw file format. So that's what this comment says here. Essentially, in Obsidian, there is no such thing as embedding but only transclusion. However, I find that people get confused with the transclusion word because it's unfamiliar, and therefore I usually resort to an easier term: embedding. But that's actually a wrong way of using the word embedding. Hopefully, this doesn't confuse you completely but makes the topic slightly clearer. I think let's just take a look at the examples of how this would work. Linking is super simple; I can very easily link. There are many ways to link; I can simply right-click and insert a link to a file. I'm just going to insert really whatever, so when choosing colors using the RYB wheel—this is a visual note—and when I do this, you can see that here, I have the text itself. If I double-click on this, then you can see that this is actually a Wiki link to the file, and this is the name of the file. Here you can see the link indicator with the same link. Now, the way this works is exactly the same with any type of file. I'm not going to show you all the different types of files because I can very easily link with insert link to file. Now, equally, if I have an object and I'm going to have this rectangle here, when the rectangle is selected, again, I can right-click and select insert link to file. When I do this, the same popup comes up; I could search for any file here, but I’m just going to go with one from the list because here we are really just trying to demonstrate how the linking works. When I do this, you can see that this Markdown link was added to this note, and therefore, I have my link there. Now, the tricky bit is, if I come to this text element and I would insert a link to a file just like with the rectangle, I could actually do that. I can choose a link, and I'm going to choose a Treemap classifying and organizing ideas and things. You can see here that there was a message that said no, you cannot do that because this already has a link. A new link was created here. The point is that if you have a text element, always the text link takes precedence over the element link feature. If you have a text link and an element link, then the text link will overwrite your element link on the text element. This is not the same with rectangles because rectangles only have element links. Now links can also come from external to Excalidraw. For example, this is my YouTube channel. If I drag this in here, then this is just simply going to insert the link. Now you can see that this link automatically converted to text, which in this case is not very helpful because I think this comes from somewhere I don’t know. I’m not sure why this is the text. I will need to double-check that. There is a feature in Excalidraw that if the web page has a title, then there’s an external service that I'm using to convert the link. Let’s just take a look at the plugin in settings. So if I come to Excalidraw plugin settings here and I scroll down to links, transclusions, and todos, I think this is the one. Then I need to scroll down and look for “Iframely.” Here you go! Use Iframely to resolve page title. When this is turned on, then when you drop a link into Excalidraw, then the Iframely service is opened, and the value I get back from Iframely is the text that you can see here. So this name here, before you continue, comes from Iframely. Frankly, I don't know why. But in the case of other pages, this is usually a meaningful title. But you can also turn off Iframely, and in that case, when I drag a link in here, then it’s just simply going to be the normal web URL. I can also add links from my file system. So if I come here, I can simply drag any file here, and I have all sorts of options. Here, I need to press Control on Windows to insert a link with a local URI. You can see here that this URI to this element was inserted. By the way, where do you find what modifier keys to use? You can come to plugin settings and in plugin settings, you can come to Excalidraw appearance and behavior. Here, you can scroll down to link click-and-drag modifier keys, and here you can come to OS local file drag action. You can see this is the insert local URI, which was the Control button. But as I drag it here, there's a hint there, and as I press different buttons or combinations of modifier keys, I get different options on-screen. I know what's going to happen. Then I let the mouse button go, and finally, I can also drag and drop items from the file explorer. So this is the Obsidian file explorer or from the recent file. So if I drag this here, then by default, it's going to be a link. So now I added a link to the SWOT analysis file. I think that’s all about linking to different types of objects. I'm going to delete these now. Let's look at transclusion. This is the tricky part. The easy one is to transclude an image. My favorite is to use the insert any file function, and here I'm just going to type, for example, a picture from MidJourney. I get one of the pictures that I created on MidJourney. So let’s, for example, insert this picture as an image—there you go! So I inserted this; I transcluded this image. How do I know this is transcluded? Because you cannot embed in Obsidian Excalidraw. If I Control-click on this, you can see that I can open the original file, which is here in my "Practicing Stoic" book folder. I can simply click on this, and then the file is opened. I have the Reveal Active File plugin installed, so if I have the active file here, I click on this, and it will reveal it to me in the file explorer. So you can see that this image comes from my Obsidian file system, and I just simply transcluded it here. You can also notice when I Control-click on it that I also have a second-order link, and sometimes there are many second-order links here. The idea is that you can navigate between ideas by using the same image. In this case, I can immediately jump to the second-order link. I could also just open this file and then look for the backlinks and open the next file. But this is what I mean: if I Control-click on this, let’s do that first, and I look at backlinks, then you can see here that I have these two files. So I have "Everything that is Beautiful" here, but I can also get to that drawing if I Control-click on this. You can see that I have a second-order link to "Everything is Beautiful," and then here's my illustration for that idea. So that was transcluding an image. I’m going to delete that now. I can also transclude an Excalidraw document. The way I'm going to demonstrate a couple of things is I'm going to first create a simple drawing here. Let me just say, this is going to be a sun. Let's make it yellow like that, and I'm going to create some mountains here like this. So this is going to be a super simple image. And what I’m going to do is the way I’m going to make this into a file of its own that I can transclude is I’m going to use a script. The pizza slicer is the default icon; it’s not here. You need to install it from Excalidraw scripts, and it’s called "Construct Selected Elements into New Drawing" script. It will also appear in the tools panel right here under downloaded, but I have pinned it here by just long pressing on the button. But that’s not the topic of our discussion now. So I’m going to deconstruct this image, and I’m going to call this "Mountain," just like that. The way I’m going to insert this is to use my base template, and I’m just going to insert it. Then this image is transcluded. Then of course, if I come here and add something to the image, let’s say I’m going to add this snow cap to my image like that. We’ll leave that color. If I come back to this other image, then you will see that that snow cap is right there. But equally, what I can do is I’m going to create a vehicle here— a small car. I’m going to just draw a very simple vehicle here. I’m just going to do it like this, so this is not the most beautiful car that I’ve ever drawn. Of course, if I come back, you will see that that vehicle is right there. But I can deconstruct this vehicle into a next drawing, so that’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to call this "Car," and I’m going to insert it like that. Now, let’s move this here. Let’s open the original drawing as well, and move it to the left so you can see everything. Now what happened is this car is no longer editable here because that’s a transcluded image. If I change my car here on the side, the way I’m going to change it is just to make the tires red like this. Then, when I come to the next image, it’s going to be updated to reflect that. In the background, I pressed Ctrl+s on the mountain; otherwise, this next image would not be alerted that it’s updated. If I closed and reopened it, it would. Now, that was just for demonstration purposes, but if you want to try this, note that on the mountain, I pressed Ctrl+s. There’s a refresh, and this third image is notified that it needs to update. But the point I’m trying to show you is this is the nesting thing that I’m talking about—that the image here on this drawing is actually a reference to the image here, and this has a reference to this image. If we draw a person here driving the car—maybe like this, so this is going to be our guy driving the vehicle, then of course that person is going to appear in my next image again, and I’m pressing Ctrl+s so it will transpire to my last image. This is the idea about nesting multiple levels of drawings. So that’s about nesting. There’s a feature about nesting at 100%. I’m not going to go into that now; there are many reasons why you would want to do that. I recommend you experiment with that. But you can also embed or transclude different types of documents. So I can simply transclude Markdown documents. The way I would do that is I would open insert any file, and I would insert "Porter’s Five Forces." That’s a good document to embed. Now, I have two options here. When it’s a Markdown document, I can either transclude the file as an embeddable or as an image. If I press as an embeddable, then you can see here that an interactive frame was inserted, and I can go ahead and edit this document right here. That’s when I insert an embeddable, but what I want to show you is if I take this embeddable—for this is red because embeddables cannot be nested—so let’s take this and I’m going to place this on the clipboard. I’m going to cut this from here; I’m going to open this mountain image right here, and on the mountain image, I’m going to add this embeddable, and I’m going to shrink it very small so it fits somewhere here, that it doesn’t become overly big. So you can see here I have my Porter's Five Forces. By the way, the way I resized this was I held down Shift, and when I resize with Shift, then it will scale the image. If I just resize like this, then you can see that the area becomes smaller, and the text remains the same size. If I resize it, I will be able to show less content. If I shift-resize it, I will scale it, and it will be smaller and still the same amount of text fits. But anyway, put that aside. So I’ve added this interactive frame here. Now, if I come back, this is going to be updated, but you can see here that the Markdown document will appear as a gray box, and that’s currently, well you could say it’s a feature. I have some ideas on how to address this, but there are many reasons why it appears like this that I don’t want to bore you with. There’s another option that you can do, and I’m going to delete "Porter's Five Forces" from here. Okay, so I’m going to transclude my summary of emergence, and I’m going to transclude maybe the mid— the introduction section as an image. So what you will see here is now this is a Markdown document that’s transcluded as an image. Let me just make this smaller like this. So I have my transcluded Markdown document as an image. Of course, now this is not scrollable; this is just a view of the document. You can modify some parameters of this on Windows. It’s Control Windows click, and then here I can add a width and a height to this document. I’m not going to do that. What I want to show you is now, if I come back here, then you will see that the gray box will be replaced with this image of the Markdown document. So if you want to embed a Markdown document such that it will be visible on the next layer and the next layer of the Excalidraw drawing, then you can embed it as an image instead of an embeddable. When you do that, it will actually be displayed as an image. Again, we could talk for hours about this. I just want to get the basic idea across. Now, you can also embed a section—that's actually what we did here and what we did previously. So if I come back again, and I embed summary emergence, I can also select the "Myth of the Ant Queen," and maybe this time I'm going to embed this as an embeddable. Then you can see here that this becomes a Markdown document but only with a reference to this section. Now, what I could also do is I could copy this link right here. So I'm just going to place this link on the clipboard. I'm going to delete this and delete this and come back to my main page. I can also add this link. So this is now a reference to this section right there. I’m going to resize this like this so it starts to wrap. When I resize the text element, it’s going to wrap the text. What I want to do is to put an exclamation mark here, and this is going to transclude the document as a text element here. So now you can see that this is not the most beautiful Markdown text that you can see here, but what you can see is how this text from this section of my summary of emergence was transcluded here as plain text. Now, in this case, this might not look super valuable, but here’s an interesting use case that you can do: I can add a text element here. By the way, so we are now down here. So we looked at how we can transclude as an embeddable, as an image, and also as text. But let me show you one interesting thing. An Excalidraw drawing is also by default a Markdown document. So in a Markdown document, you can transclude a text element. This is my text element, and now we’re going to first show you a feature, and then we’ll look under the hood so you understand what this feature is. The feature I’m going to show you is I’m going to copy the Markdown link for this element, and I’m going to just simply click on the link. Now, it’s on the clipboard, and I’m going to come here and simply press the exclamation mark and press space. With that, I’ve inserted this element right here. You can see that if I change this text here— maybe I’m going to add two exclamation marks—at first, it seems nothing happens. But when I press Ctrl+s, that automatically refreshes the page and this text element was updated. This now has two features: A, if I click on this link, it takes me to the original place in the document, but B, if I change the text here, it will change here as well. Why is this good? For example, if you're doing some process modeling and you have an actor or an activity, a system, or something in your process model, and you want to call it the same way every place, instead of typing in the name every time, you can add the link. What’s the benefit? The benefit is, if you need to change it, you need to change it in one place, and it will automatically change everywhere else. But let me show you what’s under the hood. So, this is our text right here. I'm now going to open this document in Markdown view mode. I’m going to close this and open this right here. Under text elements, you can see here I have lots of text elements because on this page, I have lots of text, but you can see here that this is my reference to that text element. So this is the second element I embedded. That was a link to the original element, and what you can see here is each of the text elements have a block reference and an ID that I can use to reference this piece of text, of course, in other Markdown documents, but within Excalidraw as well. Mind the gap, and this is a special feature. I just want to show you that in case someone is actually using this feature. Let me close this. So this is my GPT discussion to clarify the terminology. You can add Markdown comments here to hide the Excalidraw data section, but when you do this, then Obsidian will stop indexing the text elements that you have here. The effect is going to be that when I open this page, then this no longer reads as the text element but only as the link. That is because I’m using the Obsidian metadata indexer to get the content of the text element, and because this is now a Markdown comment, it’s no longer visible. If I come down here and remove the comment section and switch back to Excalidraw view mode, then voila, my text element is back because now the element is indexed again. Hopefully, that was not too much detail. So we talked about Markdown pages, sections, and blocks, and then they can reference videos. I have no videos in my Obsidian vault, but it works exactly well. Maybe I do have some videos here, so if I want to reference, I have no idea what the Angry Bird video is. I can reference it as an embeddable like this, and then this is now from my Obsidian vault. You can see I could also Control-click on this, and then it would open in a new tab. I’m going to just mute this and start it. So, yeah, this is me drawing an Angry Bird on my iPad. This is how I drew that Angry Bird. Anyway, so you can embed videos as embeddables, and again, if you embed a video as an embeddable in an Excalidraw drawing and then you nest it into another one, then the video is going to be grayed out. Now, going on, you can also do similar things from the web. It is really extremely similar. So from the web, I can take a YouTube video and embed it. I’m going to copy a link, and if I come back here and paste the link, then the video is embedded. Now, I can also embed the video as a thumbnail image. So here, I’m going to drag this over here, and if I just drop it like this, then this is going to be inserted as a thumbnail image via a link to YouTube. It seems there is something—why doesn’t this work? It works; something was up with the location. If I drag this in here and drop it—it's interesting that for some of the videos, there is no thumbnail. For the newer ones, there is. I may have found a bug here. Let’s see... Yeah, for the newer videos, I do have a thumbnail image. For the older ones, I don’t. I’m going to investigate why but the point is these are now not interactive. If I want to embed this interactively, then I need to copy the link and paste it, and then it’s going to become an interactive video. In this case, this is embedded as the YouTube thumbnail image, and then you can click the video if you want to save the thumbnail image to your vault for safekeeping. Then you can right-click on this image from the web and save the image from the URL as a local file. You can download this image and save it in your Obsidian vault, which is good. Again, if you think about the long term, then you actually want these images in Obsidian. Finally, of course, you can also embed web pages. I’m going to open Obsidian MD as my example and drag the web page in. The basic drag-and-drop action is to insert it as a link, and if I press Control+Shift on Windows, then it’s going to be inserted as an interactive file, which practically means this is going to be inserted as a web page. So that’s, I think, the way you can get web pages in. Finally, from your local file system, you can embed images. For example, here I have this image. I can import an external file, or I can insert an image with a local call URI. This is what I want to do. The import external file will copy the external file into my Obsidian vault. The insert image with local URI—on Windows, I need to press Shift. You need to play with these modifiers to see in your environment which is the right key. In settings, as I showed you before, you can configure this. If I hold down Shift and let go of the mouse button, then this image is now referenced from my local drive. I can see some use cases for this. However, if you use your vault on multiple devices, then this is not going to work—this image is not going to be there when you move to another device unless you synchronize your entire file system to that other device. Also, these local file references do not work on Obsidian Mobile, which means Android and iOS, and tablets and phones. So on an iPad or on your iPhone, this local file reference is not going to work. I think I'm not going to show you, but of course, you could drag. I don’t really have an example here—a document or something like that—and if I would do that, then of course it cannot be embedded; you will have a link and when you click it, then you're prompted to open it in the native app. So you can do that. Finally, embedding, as I said, for the most part Excalidraw does not support embedding. If you come here, export as an image and select export to Excalidraw, I’m actually going to export an image outside your vault. I want to show you two things. First off, I can show you that now this image is almost 6 megabytes large. Frankly, I don’t really have that—I mean, I have a couple of images here, but this is what I mean by these images becoming large. If I now come over to Excalidraw.com, I can actually open this downloaded image here, and you will see that it sort of loads, but not everything loads. Excalidraw.com does not support many of the web pages. So for example, my ChatGPT web page is not displayed here. Also, the jumping monkey was a local GIF, and that is not included. Let me show you that—maybe something we haven't yet talked about, but other than that, some of the images were actually embedded and they appear in the file. In this case, these are embedded. Whatever is not gray is embedded in this file; whatever is gray is, of course, just a gray box. Let’s just look at our jumping monkey as our last topic. The jumping monkey GIF is actually If I insert it as an image, I get a static image. The way Excalidraw handles images is it will not move. If I now would export this and load it in Excalidraw.com, then a static image of the monkey would be there. But I can also embed this GIF as an embeddable, and I think if I change these colors to transparent so that there's a bug that I observed, if this is transparent, then it translates to a dark color. So I need to set this to a light background color, and now you can see that I’ve imported my monkey here, and it’s nicely jumping up and down because it’s an embeddable. This image is actually not an image here but it operates just like an embedded Markdown file or maybe a video from your vault, and as such, this is going to appear as a gray box when you nest Excalidraw into something else. So I think that is enough for today. You can, I guess, from this amount of conversation, see how this is a pretty long and complex topic. The key takeaway is linking, of course, is simple. You can link from your vault, from the web, and from your local file system, and you can use Markdown links, wiki links, as well as HTTP links. Transclusion is what Excalidraw and Obsidian does for the most part when you place images and other objects into Excalidraw. These are always stored somewhere else, not in the Excalidraw file, but if you export it, you can actually package everything into a single file. Finally, embedding is when you store a copy of the file within the Excalidraw file. This is not really supported by Obsidian Excalidraw, and that is a deliberate choice. I have lots of reasons; many of them I didn't mention here, but I think it’s just not good practice to embed. So those are the options, and I really hope you found this video helpful. I recognized that I was rambling a bit, and I didn’t really prepare that much for this video. I thought this was going to be more of a long-winded explainer video. I hope you found it helpful. If you're still here, then I guess you did, and I hope to see you in my next video. Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM)

## YouTube Transcript

[hey everyone jolt here I wanted to spend](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=0) [a few minutes talking about linking](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2) [transclusion and embedding this topic](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=5) [came up at the office hours in cohort 9](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=7) [last week and we ended up talking about](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=10) [these topics for almost an hour and my](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=14) [takeaway from all of this was that](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=18) [obviously this is confusing to people](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=20) [and I could do a better job at](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=23) [explaining what excolo can and cannot do](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=26) [so in this video I'll try to walk you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=30) [through some of the basic concepts and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=32) [hopefully by the end you will have a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=36) [much better understanding of the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=38) [difference between these terms and what](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=40) [excolo can and cannot do in obsidian so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=42) [let's dive in we are going to explore](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=47) [these three topics I also have a table](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=51) [with a number of examples that we are](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=53) [going to go through so hopefully this is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=55) [going to be all clear](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=58) [on this opening page what you can see](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=60) [here is I have a web page here so of](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=63) [course I can embed web pages I have this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=65) [image of a dock here I have this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=68) [markdown document from my wult so I can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=71) [edit and move it this document I also](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=74) [have a YouTube video embedded here as](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=77) [well as I have this animated gif and of](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=81) [course I could have many other things](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=84) [but let's just start to dive in here and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=86) [first talk about the easy stuff so what](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=90) [are the different type of objects you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=92) [can embed into exetra so you can embed](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=94) [images and images can be either excolo](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=98) [images or other image formats like PNG](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=101) [SVG Etc they can be markdown documents](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=104) [and there are actually two different](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=108) [ways of embedding markdown which we look](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=110) [at you can embed video from within the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=113) [Vault and from outside the Vault you you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=116) [can embed web pages and of course you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=120) [can embed links to other files but those](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=122) [links will just be links so when you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=126) [click on it then either the obsidian](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=128) [built-in feature will function or you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=131) [will be prompted to go outside obsidian](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=135) [and use the default tool on your](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=138) [device and also the easy part of the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=142) [discussion from where can you embed well](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=146) [you can embed from the obsidian Vault](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=150) [and frankly this is my primary](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=152) [approach my mindset with PKM is I'm](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=156) [building a system for the next decades](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=160) [not couple of years but really 20 30](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=163) [years and I still use notes from 30](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=167) [years ago and for me linking to images](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=170) [on the web or linking to stuff on my](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=174) [drive outside of obsidian is sort of it](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=177) [beats the purpose it's sort of](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=182) [meaningless of course YouTube videos I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=184) [do link to but otherwise I try to keep](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=187) [everything in my Vault so it's in one](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=190) [place easy to handle easy to manage but](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=192) [you can also link to files on your local](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=197) [drive as well as you can link to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=200) [resources on the web and now let's come](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=202) [to the harder part so what does](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=206) [what type of references can you create](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=210) [what does linking mean what does](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=212) [transclusion mean and what does](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=214) [embedding mean so let's go through these](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=216) [one by one I think the easiest is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=219) [linking a link is simply a reference to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=223) [a resource you know about hyperlinks you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=227) [know about Vicky links and you know](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=230) [about markdown links so those are the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=232) [type of links you can create in](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=234) [obsidian and in ex it specifically and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=238) [in this case there are two different](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=242) [type of links and I'm going to show you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=245) [examples in just a moment so now we're](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=247) [just talking about getting the big](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=249) [picture you can create links by typing](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=251) [the text the link text in a text element](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=256) [and then it's a text element link or you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=259) [can add links to any object in exol draw](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=262) [and then it becomes an element link and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=266) [then in the top corner](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=268) [you have this icon that is the link](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=270) [indicator and then you know you have a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=273) [link there you can click it and you can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=275) [navigated so that's easy now I think](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=278) [transclusion is where people start to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=282) [feel uncertain what the heck does](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=286) [transclusion mean and where why am I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=289) [using the word transclusion instead of](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=292) [embedding does it mean the same thing or](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=295) [something different so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=297) [transclusion is when you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=300) [embed when you include part of an image](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=304) [or part of a document part of something](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=308) [you reference a part of something in](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=311) [another document you don't embedd it you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=314) [only have a reference it will appear as](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=317) [if it's there but the file the content](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=320) [is actually not there it's only a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=324) [reference to that file or to the part of](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=327) [the file that you want to show and this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=330) [is what actually exol draw and obsidian](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=333) [does for most of the parts or](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=337) [practically all the time I don't embed](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=340) [the objects you create or the images you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=344) [add to excolo they are not in the excolo](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=347) [file they're always](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=350) [transcluded from somewhere within your](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=353) [Vault now there are some differences](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=356) [here that might make this a bit more](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=359) [confusing so you can have two types of](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=362) [transclusions you can have interactive](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=367) [transclusions and these are called](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=370) [embeddables and then example would be a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=374) [YouTube video or the web page so the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=376) [examples I showed in the beginning are](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=379) [interactive transclusions that are](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=382) [called embeddables](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=385) [sometimes they are also called I frames](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=386) [though I'm trying to get rid of that](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=390) [terminology and use the word embeddable](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=393) [consistently so those are the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=396) [interactive](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=398) [transclusions and you have static](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=400) [transclusions for example these images](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=402) [like this TV set here with the uh](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=405) [infinite uh cycle of TV images nested](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=409) [into one another that's a set of static](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=414) [transcluded images of icons or this is a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=418) [transclusion here as well a static image](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=422) [uh that you can see the keyhole with an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=426) [image behind the keyhole so that's the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=430) [static transclusion when you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=433) [embed and again I'm using this word and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=435) [you'll see why I'm mixing up](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=438) [transclusion and embed uh so so easily](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=440) [but so static transclusion is when you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=446) [place an image and you display it in](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=449) [exol draw and and it doesn't move you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=452) [cannot interact with it and finally you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=456) [have](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=459) [nesting and nesting is really a static](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=460) [transclusion the reason I talk about](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=464) [nesting separately is because one](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=467) [special feature of exol draw in obsidian](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=470) [is you can deconstruct or decompose](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=474) [parts of an image and show you again in](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=478) [a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=480) [moment and you can do that several](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=481) [layers deep you can sort of create exro](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=484) [pieces and as a set of Lego pieces that](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=488) [you build into components and then work](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=491) [with those components as a higher level](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=494) [Lego piece you can build up](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=497) [images um several layers deep so we'll](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=501) [see that in a second but essentially I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=505) [use nesting here as the static](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=508) [transclusion of exol images within exol](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=512) [and I call it nesting because it can be](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=517) [several layers deep and then let's move](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=519) [to the final concept here which is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=523) [embedding and by the dictionary](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=527) [embedding means saving a copy of an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=531) [object within another file so in this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=535) [case when when you embed then you can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=538) [actually delete the original object and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=542) [everything will be contained in the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=546) [place where you embedded it on exol](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=548) [draw.com when you place an image when](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=551) [you copy an image on excal](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=555) [docomo file that image is going to be](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=560) [embedded in exol draw the same here if I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=564) [export this page as an excolo file then](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=568) [the images are going to be](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=573) [embedded and in that case the file is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=576) [fully](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=579) [self-contained with all the pieces](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=581) [however and that's also images are](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=583) [embedded when you export to any image](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=586) [format then of course now this only](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=589) [really is Meaningful when you export SVG](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=593) [files because bngs are just bit Maps but](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=596) [so that's embedding now in obsidian exol](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=599) [draw this is practically not supported](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=603) [and it's not supported for a reason and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=607) [the reason is that exol files are](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=610) [markdown files and when you embed images](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=614) [images are typically large files I can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=618) [embed images there are ways of encoding](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=622) [image files that they can be placed in](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=625) [markdown files but the markdown files](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=628) [become big and obsidian the indexing](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=630) [engine in obsidian then the whole uh](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=634) [environment is not designed to handle](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=637) [super large files and for this reason](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=640) [and also from a PKM perspective from a a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=643) [linking and thinking perspective it's](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=647) [actually counterproductive to embed](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=651) [images because that will limit the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=655) [reusability in instead I have the image](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=658) [object or the video object and I keep it](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=661) [separate from the drawing it is only](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=665) [transcluded reference in the image but](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=668) [as I mentioned embedding is the default](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=672) [behavior on exito.com and so now you can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=675) [hopefully start to understand why I'm](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=680) [confused with these terms because](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=683) [essentially in ex po obsidian](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=687) [transclusion is equal to embedding or I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=692) [can use the terms interchangeably](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=696) [because there is no real difference you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=699) [can see here that embedding is pretty](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=701) [much not supported only for image types](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=704) [and only when you export to the excal](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=707) [file format so that's what this commment](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=710) [says here so essentially in obsidian](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=712) [there is no such thing as as embedding](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=717) [but only transclusion however I find](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=720) [that people get confused with the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=723) [transclusion word because it's](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=726) [unfamiliar and therefore I usually](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=728) [resort to an easier term edding but](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=732) [that's actually a wrong way of using the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=736) [word embedding so hopefully this doesn't](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=739) [confuse you completely but makes the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=742) [topic slightly clearer but I think let's](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=745) [just take a look at the examples of how](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=748) [this would work so the linking is super](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=751) [simple I can very easily link there are](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=755) [many ways to link I can just simply](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=759) [rightclick and I can insert link to file](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=762) [and I'm just going to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=766) [insert really whatever so when choosing](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=768) [colors use the r YB wheel this is a a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=772) [zle cast note and when I do this you can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=777) [see that here I have the the text itself](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=781) [if I double click on this then you can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=785) [see that this is actually a Vicky link](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=787) [to the file and this is the name of the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=792) [file and here you can see the link](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=794) [indicator with the same link now the way](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=797) [um this works this works exactly the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=802) [same with any type of file I'm not going](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=806) [going to show you all the different type](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=809) [of files because any type of file I can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=811) [very easily link with insert link to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=814) [file now equally if I have an object and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=818) [I'm going to have this rectangle here](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=823) [when the rectangle is selected I can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=825) [again rightclick and select insert link](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=828) [to file and when I do this the same](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=832) [popup comes up I could search for any](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=836) [file here but I'm just going to go with](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=841) [one from the list because here we are](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=844) [really just trying to demonstrate how](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=846) [the linking works when I do this then](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=848) [you can see that this markdown link was](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=851) [added to this note and therefore I have](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=855) [my link there now the tricky bit is if I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=859) [come to this text element and I would](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=865) [insert a link to a file just like with](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=869) [the rectangle I could actually do that](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=873) [so I can choose a link and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=876) [choose a Tre map classifying and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=879) [organizing ideas and things and so you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=882) [can see here that the there was a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=885) [message that no you cannot do that](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=890) [because this already has a link so a new](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=892) [link was uh created here so the point is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=896) [that if you have a text element always](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=900) [the text link so the link in the text](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=904) [takes precedence over the link in the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=908) [element link](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=913) [feature and if you have a text link and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=915) [an element link then the text link will](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=919) [overwrite your element link on the text](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=922) [element this is not the same with](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=926) [rectangles because of course the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=928) [rectangles only have element links now](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=930) [links can also come from external to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=934) [exol so for example this is my YouTube](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=937) [channel if I drag this in here then this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=941) [is just simply going to uh insert the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=945) [link now you can see that this link um](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=948) [automatically uh converted to a text](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=952) [which in this case is not very helpful](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=956) [because um yeah frankly I I I think this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=959) [comes from I don't know where the why](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=964) [this is the text I will need to double](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=968) [check that there is a feature in exol](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=970) [that if the web page](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=973) [has a um a title then there's an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=975) [external service that I'm using to um](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=981) [convert the link let's just take a look](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=985) [at plugin in settings so if I come to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=988) [excolo plugin settings here and I scroll](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=990) [down to uh links transclusions and todos](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=995) [I think this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1000) [is this is the one then I need to scroll](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1002) [down and look for if Fram](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1006) [Le here you go so use I Fram Le to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1010) [resolve page title so when this is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1013) [turned on then when you drop a link into](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1016) [exol draw then the if Fram service is uh](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1020) [opened and the value I get back from if](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1025) [Fram Le is the text that you can see](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1029) [here so this name here before you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1032) [continue comes from I Fram family](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1035) [frankly I don't know why this uh but in](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1038) [case of other Pages this is use usually](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1041) [a meaningful title but you can also turn](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1045) [off if frame and in that case when I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1048) [drag a link in here then it's just](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1050) [simply going to be the uh normal web URL](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1053) [now I can also uh add links here from uh](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1058) [my uh my file system so if I come here I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1062) [can just simply drag any file here and I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1067) [have all sorts of](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1072) [um all sorts of options so here I need](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1075) [to press on Windows control to insert a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1078) [link with a local URI and you can see](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1082) [here that this URI to this element was](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1085) [inserted by the way where do you find](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1091) [what modifier keys to use you can come](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1095) [to again plug-in settings and in plugin](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1098) [settings you can come to EXC color](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1102) [appearance and behavior and here scroll](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1105) [down to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1108) [link click and drag and drop modifier](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1109) [keys and here you can come to uh OS](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1112) [local file drag action and here you can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1117) [see this is the insert local](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1121) [URI that was the control button but](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1124) [that's why I have so I'm not sure you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1129) [not this but as I drag it here there's a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1132) [hint there and as I press different](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1136) [buttons or combinations of modifier](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1139) [keys I get different options on screen](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1142) [and I know what's going to happen then I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1146) [let the mouse button go and finally I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1149) [can also drag and drop items from the um](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1153) [file explorer so this is the obsidian](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1158) [File Explorer or from the recent file so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1161) [if I drag this here then by default it's](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1165) [going going to be a link so now I added](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1168) [a link to the swap analysis](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1171) [file so I think in an Nell that's all](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1174) [about linking to uh different type of](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1178) [objects so I'm going to just delete](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1182) [these now let's look at transclusion so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1185) [this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1189) [is the tricky](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1191) [part the easy one is to transclude an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1194) [image my favorite is to use the insert](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1199) [any file function and here I'm just](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1202) [going to type](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1205) [picture mid Journey so I get uh a one of](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1208) [the the pictures that I created on Mid](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1214) [Journey so let's for example insert this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1217) [picture as an image and there you go so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1220) [I inserted this I transcluded this image](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1224) [so so how do I know this is transcluded](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1228) [a because you cannot embed in obsidian](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1231) [xcro but if I control click on this then](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1234) [here you can see that I can open the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1238) [original file it's here in my practicing](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1242) [stoic book folder I can just simply](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1246) [click on this and then the file is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1249) [opened and I have](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1252) [the uh reveal active file plugin](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1256) [installed so if I have the active file](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1259) [here I click on this then it will reveal](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1261) [it to me in the file explorer so you can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1265) [see that this image comes from my](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1268) [obsidian file system and I just simply](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1272) [transcluded it here also you can notice](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1274) [when I control clicked on it then I also](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1278) [have a second order link and sometimes](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1281) [there are many second order links here](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1285) [the idea is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1288) [that you can navigate between ideas by](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1289) [way of using the same image and in this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1293) [case I can immediately jump to the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1296) [second order link I could also just open](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1300) [this file and then look for the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1303) [backlinks and open the next file but so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1304) [this is what I mean if I control click](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1308) [on this let's do that first and I look](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1310) [at backlinks then you can see here that](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1313) [I have these two files so I have uh](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1316) [everything that is beautiful](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1320) [here but I can also get to that drawing](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1323) [if I control click on this then you can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1328) [see here that I have a second order link](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1330) [to everything is beautiful and then](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1333) [here's my illustration for that uh uh](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1337) [idea so that was then I transclude an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1342) [image I'm going to delete that that now](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1347) [I can also transclude an exol draw](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1350) [document and the way I'm going to do](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1354) [this to demonstrate a couple of things](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1357) [is I'm going to first create a simple](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1361) [drawing here uh let me just uh so this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1365) [is going to be a sun let's just make it](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1369) [maybe yellow like that and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1374) [uh create create uh mountains here like](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1378) [this so this is going to be a super](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1382) [simple uh image and what I'm going to do](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1386) [is the way I'm going to make this into a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1389) [file of its own that I can transclude is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1393) [I'm going to use a script it's the it's](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1396) [the pizza slicer by default the icon is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1401) [not here it it's you need to install it](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1406) [from um exol dra scripts and it's called](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1409) [the the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1414) [construct selected elements into new](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1418) [drawing script and it will also appear](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1421) [here uh in the tools panel right here](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1424) [under](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1428) [downloaded but I I have pinned it here](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1429) [uh by just long pressing on the button](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1433) [but that's not the topic of our discuss](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1436) [question now so I'm going to deconstruct](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1438) [this image and I'm going to call this uh](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1441) [Mountain just like that and the way I'm](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1445) [going to insert this is I'm going to uh](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1449) [use my base template and I'm just going](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1453) [to insert it and open the image on this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1456) [side so then this image is transcluded](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1459) [then of course if I come here and add](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1464) [some something to the image I'm going to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1468) [add this snow cap uh to my image like](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1471) [that um we'll leave that color if I come](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1476) [back to this other image then you will](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1480) [see that that snow cap is right there](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1482) [but equally what I can do is I'm going](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1486) [to uh create a vehicle here a small uh](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1489) [car so I'm going](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1493) [to uh just draw a very uh](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1496) [simple uh vehicle here um I'm just going](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1500) [to do it like this so this is not the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1505) [most beautiful car that I've ever drawn](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1509) [of course if I come back you will see](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1512) [that that vehicle is of course right](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1514) [there but I can deconstruct this vehicle](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1517) [into a next drawing so that's what I'm](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1520) [going to do I'm going to call this uh](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1523) [car and I'm going to insert it like that](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1527) [now let's move this here to the let's](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1532) [sorry for that let's open the original](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1537) [drawing as well and move it to the left](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1541) [so you can see](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1544) [everything so now what happened is this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1545) [car is no longer editable here because](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1550) [that's a transcluded image and if I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1552) [change my car here here on the side and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1556) [the way I'm going to change it is just](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1559) [make the tires red like this then when I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1562) [come to the next image it's going to be](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1567) [updated to reflect that and now in the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1570) [background I saved I pressed controls on](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1573) [the mountain so otherwise this next](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1576) [image would not be alerted that it's](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1581) [updated if I would close and reopen it](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1583) [it would so now it was just for](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1586) [demonstration purposes but if you want](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1588) [to try this then note that on the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1591) [mountain I press control s so there's a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1594) [refresh and this uh third image is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1598) [notified that it needs to update but the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1602) [point I'm trying to show you is this is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1605) [the nest thing that I'm talking about](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1608) [that the image here on this drawing is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1610) [actually a reference to the image here](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1614) [and and this has a reference to this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1618) [image and of course if we draw a person](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1621) [here uh driving the car uh maybe like](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1625) [this so this is going to be our guy uh](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1629) [driving the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1633) [vehicle um then of course that person is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1634) [going to appear on my next image again](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1638) [I'm pressing controll s so it will](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1641) [transpire to my last image and so this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1644) [is the idea about uh nesting multiple](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1647) [levels of](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1651) [drawings so that's about nesting there's](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1654) [a feature about nesting at](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1658) [100% I'm not going to go into that now](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1661) [um there's many reasons why you would](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1665) [want to do that I recommend you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1668) [experiment with that but uh you can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1670) [also embed or trans clude different type](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1675) [of documents so I can simply transclude](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1679) [markdown documents so the way I would do](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1683) [that is I would open insert any file and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1686) [I would](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1691) [pter five forces that's a good document](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1693) [to embed now I have two options here I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1697) [can when it's a markdown document I can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1701) [either transclude the file as an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1706) [embeddable or as an image if I press as](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1710) [an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1713) [embeddable then you can see here that an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1713) [actually an interactive frame was](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1718) [inserted and I can go ahead and edit](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1721) [this document right here and so that's](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1724) [when I insert an embeddable but what I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1728) [want to show you is if I take this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1732) [embeddable that's why this is red here](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1736) [because embeddables cannot be nested so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1740) [let's take this and I'm going to uh](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1744) [place this on the clipboard so I'm going](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1747) [to cut this from here I'm going to open](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1749) [this mountain image uh right here and on](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1752) [the mountain image I'm going to add this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1756) [embeddable and I'm going to shrink it](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1760) [very slow small so it fits uh somewhere](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1762) [here that it doesn't uh become uh overly](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1766) [big so you can see here I have](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1769) [my Porters F forces by the way the way I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1772) [resized this was I held down shift and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1776) [when I resize with shift then it will](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1780) [scale the image if I just resize like](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1784) [this then you can see that the area](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1787) [becomes smaller and and the text Remains](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1790) [the Same Size so then the way I I resize](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1795) [it um I will be able to show less](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1798) [content if I shift resize it I I scale](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1802) [it then I I it will be smaller and still](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1805) [the same amount of text fits but anyway](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1809) [put that aside so I've added this uh](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1812) [interactive frame here but now if I come](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1817) [back this is going to be updated but you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1820) [can see here that the markdown document](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1822) [will appear as a gray box and that's](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1826) [currently](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1831) [um well it's actually you could say it's](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1834) [a feature I have some ideas of how to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1837) [address this but there's many reasons](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1840) [why uh it appears like this that I don't](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1843) [want to bore you with but there's](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1848) [another option uh that you can do and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1851) [I'm going to delete Porter's five forces](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1854) [from here okay so I'm going to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1857) [transclude my summary of emergence and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1859) [I'm going to uh](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1866) [transclude maybe the mid](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1868) [the the the introduction section as an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1872) [image so what you will see here is now](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1876) [this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1879) [is a markdown document that's](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1881) [transcluded](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1886) [as an image and let me just uh make this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1888) [okay so that was not uh let me just make](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1893) [this smaller like this so I have my](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1896) [transcluded markdown document as an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1899) [image of course now this is not](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1903) [scrollable this is just a view of the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1905) [document you can modify some of the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1908) [parameters of this on Windows it's](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1912) [control windows click and then here I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1915) [can add a width and a height to this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1919) [document I'm not going to do that what I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1923) [want to show you is now if I come back](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1926) [here then you will see that the gray box](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1929) [will be replaced with this image of the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1932) [markdown document so if you want to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1934) [embed a markdown document such that it](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1938) [will be visible on the next layer and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1941) [the next layer of the excal drawing then](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1944) [you can can embed](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1947) [it as an image instead of an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1949) [embeddable and when you do that then it](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1954) [will actually be displayed as an image](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1956) [again we could talk hours about this I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1960) [just want to get the basic idea](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1963) [across now you can also uh embed a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1967) [section that's actually what we did here](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1971) [and what we did previous so if I come](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1973) [back and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1976) [again I uh embed summary emergence I can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1979) [also select the myth of the end Queen](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1984) [and maybe this time I'm going to embed](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1987) [this as an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1990) [embeddable then you can see here that](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1993) [this becomes a a markdown document but](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=1996) [only with a reference uh to this uh very](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2000) [section now uh what I could also do is I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2005) [could copy this link right here so I'm](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2011) [just going to place this link on the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2015) [clipboard I'm going to delete this and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2018) [delete this and come back to my main](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2020) [page I can also add](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2023) [this link so this is now a reference to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2027) [this section right there I'm going to um](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2032) [resize this like this so it starts to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2037) [wrap when I resize the text element then](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2041) [it's going to wrap the text because what](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2044) [I want to do is I want to put an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2047) [exclamation mark here and this is going](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2049) [to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2054) [transclude the document as a text](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2055) [element here so here now you can see](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2058) [that this is this it's not the most](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2062) [beautiful uh markdown uh text that you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2065) [can see here but what you can see is how](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2068) [this uh text the text from this section](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2072) [the myth of the ant Queen this section](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2077) [of my summary of emergence was](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2079) [transcluded here as plain text now in](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2084) [this case this might not look uh super](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2088) [valuable but here's an interesting use](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2092) [case that you can do I can add add a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2095) [text element here so I can and by the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2098) [way so we are now down here so we looked](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2101) [at how we can transcluded as an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2104) [embeddable as an image but also as a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2106) [text but uh let me show you one](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2110) [interesting thing](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2113) [so an excal drawing is also by default a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2116) [markdown](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2121) [document so in a markdown document you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2122) [can transclude](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2126) [um a text element so this is my text](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2128) [element and now we're going to first I'm](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2134) [going to show you a feature and then](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2138) [we're going to look under the hood so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2141) [you understand what this feature is so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2143) [the feature I'm going to show you is I'm](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2146) [going to copy the markdown link for this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2148) [element and I'm going to just simply](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2152) [click uh on the link now it's on the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2154) [clipboard board and I'm going to come](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2157) [here and simply um press the exclamation](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2160) [mark and press](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2166) [space and with that I've inserted this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2169) [element right here so you can see that](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2174) [if I change this text here maybe I'm](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2176) [going to add two exclamation marks at](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2180) [first it seems nothing happens but when](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2182) [I press contrl s that automatically](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2185) [refreshes the page and this text element](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2188) [was updated so this now has two features](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2192) [a if I click on this link it takes me to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2195) [the uh original place in the document](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2199) [but B if I change the text here it will](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2202) [change here as well why is this good for](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2205) [example you're doing uh some uh process](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2209) [modeling and you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2213) [have an actor or an activity a system](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2215) [something in your process model and you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2219) [want to call it the same way every place](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2221) [then instead of typing in the name every](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2224) [time you can add the link what's the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2226) [benefit the benefit is if you need to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2229) [change it you need to change it in one](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2232) [place and it will automatically change](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2234) [everywhere else but let me show you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2236) [what's under the hood so this is our](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2239) [text right here I'm now going to open](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2242) [this document in marown View mode mode](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2245) [so open as markdown going to close this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2248) [and open this right here and under text](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2252) [elements you can see here I have lots of](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2255) [text elements because on this page I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2258) [have lots of um text but you can see](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2260) [here that here's my first of all this is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2264) [my reference to that text element so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2268) [this is the second element I embedded](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2271) [that was a link to the original element](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2275) [and what you can see here is each of the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2278) [text elements have a block reference and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2281) [an ID that I can use to reference this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2288) [piece of text of course in other](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2292) [markdown documents but within excital as](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2293) [well mind the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2297) [gap um and this is a special feature](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2300) [just want to show you that in case](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2304) [someone is actually](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2306) [um using this feature let me okay close](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2309) [this so this is my GPT discussion to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2313) [clarify the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2315) [terminology um you can add markdown](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2317) [comments here to hide the excolo data](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2321) [section but when you do this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2325) [then obsidian will stop indexing the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2329) [text elements that you have here so the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2334) [effect is going to be that when I open](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2338) [this page then this no longer reads as](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2341) [the text element but only as the link](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2346) [and that is because I'm using the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2350) [obsidian metadata indexer to get the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2353) [content of the text element and because](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2357) [this is now a markdown comment then it's](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2360) [it's no longer visible if I come down](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2366) [here and remove the comment section and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2368) [switch back to excal view mode then](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2372) [voila my text element is back because](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2375) [now the element is indexed again so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2379) [hopefully that was not too much detail](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2383) [so we talked about markdown Pages](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2386) [sections and blocks and then they can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2389) [reference videos I have no videos in my](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2392) [obsidian vault](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2396) [but it works exactly well maybe I do](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2398) [have so let's see](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2401) [MP4 I do have some videos here so if I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2403) [want to reference I have no idea what](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2408) [the Angry Bird video is I can reference](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2411) [it as an embeddable like this and then](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2414) [this is now from my obsidian VA so you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2418) [can see I could also control click on](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2422) [this and then it would open open in a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2426) [new tab and I'm going to just uh mute](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2427) [this and start it and so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2432) [then yeah this is me drawing an Angry](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2435) [Bird on my iPad so you can see here this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2439) [is how I drew that Angry Bird anyway so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2443) [you can embed videos as embeddables and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2447) [again if you embed a video as an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2450) [embeddable in an excal drawing and then](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2453) [you Nest it into an another one then the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2455) [video is going to be great](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2459) [out now going](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2461) [on you can also do similar things from](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2464) [the VB](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2469) [so it is really extremely similar so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2472) [from the web I can take a YouTube video](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2476) [and embed it so now I'm going to um](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2480) [share this and copy a link like that if](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2484) [I come back here and just simply contrl](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2488) [V paste the link then the video uh is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2491) [embedded now I can also embed the video](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2496) [as a thumbnail image so here I'm going](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2501) [to drag this over here and if I just](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2504) [drop it like this then this is going to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2507) [image the insert the YouTube thumbnail](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2510) [VI a link to YouTube so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2514) [and it seems](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2517) [that there is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2520) [something why doesn't this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2523) [work this it works I I something was up](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2530) [with the location so if I drag this in](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2534) [here and I drop it it's interesting that](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2536) [for some of the videos there is no](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2539) [thumbnail for the newer one there is I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2543) [may have found a book here let's see](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2546) [yeah for the newer videos I do have a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2550) [thumbnail image for the older ones not](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2552) [I'm going to investigate why but the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2556) [point is these are now not interactive](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2559) [if I want to embed this as interactive](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2562) [then I need to copy the link and I can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2566) [paste it and then it's going to be an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2570) [interactive video in this case this is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2572) [embedded as the YouTube thumbnail image](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2576) [and then you can click the video if you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2580) [want to save the thumbnail image to your](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2582) [Vault for safekeeping then you can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2586) [rightclick on this image from the web](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2589) [and save image from URL as a local file](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2592) [so you can download this image and save](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2596) [it in your obsidian vault which is good](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2599) [again if you think about the long term](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2602) [then you actually want these imag images](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2605) [in obsidian finally and of course you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2608) [can also embed web pages so here I'm](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2611) [going to just simply open obsidian MD as](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2615) [my example and I can drag the web page](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2619) [in](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2622) [here and the basic drag and drop action](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2623) [is to insert it as a link and if I then](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2627) [uh press control shift on Windows then](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2632) [it's going to be inserted as an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2635) [interactive file which practically means](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2637) [this is going to be inserted as a web](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2640) [page so that's uh I think the way how](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2644) [you can get web pages in and finally](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2647) [from your local file system you can uh](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2651) [embed images so for example here I have](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2654) [this image I can import external file or](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2659) [I can insert image with local call Uri](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2664) [this is what I want to do so the import](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2668) [external file will copy the external](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2671) [file into my obsidian VA](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2674) [the insert image with local URI so on](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2678) [Windows I need to press shift uh you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2682) [need to play with these modifiers ke see](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2685) [in your environment which is the right](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2688) [key and in settings as I showed you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2691) [before you can configure this if I hold](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2693) [down shift and let let go of the mouse](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2696) [button then this image is now referenced](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2698) [from my local](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2702) [drive I can see some use cases for this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2705) [however if you use your Vault on](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2709) [multiple devices then this is not going](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2712) [to this image is of course not going to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2715) [be there when you move to another device](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2717) [unless you synchronize your entire file](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2720) [system to that other device and also the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2723) [these uh local file references do not](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2727) [work on obsidian mobile which](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2731) [means Android and iOS and tablets and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2735) [phones so on iPad or on your](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2739) [iPhone this local file reference so we](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2743) [are talking about this here this is not](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2747) [going to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2750) [work and I think I'm not going to show](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2752) [you but so of course you could drag I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2755) [don't really have an example here uh a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2758) [document or something like that and if I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2762) [would do that then of course it cannot](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2765) [be embedded you will have a link and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2768) [when you click it then you're prompted](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2772) [to open it uh in the native app and so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2773) [you can do that and finally](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2777) [embedding as I said for the most part](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2782) [excal obsidian does not support](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2785) [embedding if you come here export image](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2789) [and you select export to uh excetra and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2793) [I'm actually going to export image](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2796) [outside your Vault I'm going to export](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2799) [the entire scene to excit so then I can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2802) [uh save this file right here I want to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2808) [show you two things first off I can show](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2811) [you that now this](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2815) [image uh so this image now is almost 6](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2817) [megabytes large and frankly I don't](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2823) [really have that I mean I have couple of](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2826) [images here but this is what I mean by](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2829) [these images becoming large and if I now](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2833) [come over to exit.com I can actually](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2836) [open this downloaded image here and you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2841) [will see that](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2845) [it sort of loads not everything loads so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2847) [EXC colo.com does not support many of](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2851) [the web pages so for example my CH GPT](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2854) [web page is not displayed here also the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2859) [jumping monkey was a local GIF and that](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2863) [is not included because it's an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2867) [embeddable and let me show you that so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2870) [that maybe something we haven't yet](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2872) [talked about but other than that uh some](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2875) [of the images were actually uh embedded](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2878) [and they appear uh in the file and in](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2882) [this case these are embedded whatever is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2885) [not gray is embedded in this file](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2887) [whatever is gray is of course it's just](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2892) [a gray](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2895) [box but so let's just look at our](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2896) [jumping monkey as our last uh topic so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2900) [the jumping monkey](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2904) [JF is actually if I insert it as an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2909) [image then I get a static image so the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2912) [way exol handles images it will not](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2915) [move and if I now would export it and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2919) [load it in EXC colo.com then a static](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2922) [image of the monkey would be there but I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2926) [can also embed](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2929) [this uh gif as a as an embeddable and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2934) [then my monkey is embedded and I think](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2938) [if I change these colors to transparent](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2942) [so the there's a bug that I observed](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2946) [that if this is transparent then](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2949) [transparent translates to a dark color](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2951) [so I need to set this a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2953) [um a light background color and now you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2957) [can see that I've imported my uh monkey](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2961) [here and it's nicely jumping up and down](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2965) [because it's an inter it's an embeddable](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2970) [uh and this image is actually not an](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2973) [image here but a it operates just like](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2977) [an embedded markdown file or maybe a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2981) [video from your](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2986) [Vault and as such this is going to](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2987) [appear as a gray box when you Nest](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2991) [excolo into something else](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2993) [so I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2998) [think that is enough for today um you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=2999) [can I guess from this uh amount of](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3004) [conversation you can see how this is a](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3007) [pretty long and complex topic but the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3010) [key takeaway](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3014) [is linking of course is simple you can](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3016) [link from your Vault from the web and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3021) [from your local f system and you can use](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3025) [markdown links viky links and as well as](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3029) [URL so](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3034) [HTTP um links transclusion is what exol](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3035) [drawing obsidian does for the most part](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3041) [when you uh Place images and other](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3044) [objects into exol draw these are always](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3048) [stored somewhere else not in the exol](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3052) [draw file but if you you export it then](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3055) [you can actually package everything into](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3058) [a single file and finally embedding is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3061) [when you have you store a copy of the](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3066) [file within the exol file this is not](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3069) [really supported by obsidian xol draw](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3074) [and that is because of a reason so it's](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3077) [very deliberate choice on my uh end and](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3080) [I have lots of reasons many of them I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3084) [didn't mention here but I think it's](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3086) [just not good practice to uh](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3089) [embed and so those are the options and I](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3093) [really hope you found this video helpful](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3098) [I recognized that I was rambling a bit](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3100) [and I didn't really prepare that much](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3103) [for this video I thought um this is](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3106) [going to be more of a long vended](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3110) [explainer video I hope you found it](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3113) [helpful well you're if you're still here](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3116) [then I guess you did and I hope to see](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3118) [you in my next video thank you](https://youtu.be/CpSwwv1CPMM?t=3121)
