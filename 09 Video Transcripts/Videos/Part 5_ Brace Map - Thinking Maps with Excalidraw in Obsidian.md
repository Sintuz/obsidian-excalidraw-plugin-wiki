![Part 5: Brace Map - Thinking Maps with Excalidraw in Obsidian](https://youtu.be/rltMZP3U9d8)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt introduces the concept of a brace map as part of the Visual PKM series, focusing on how to break down a concept into its component parts. Using the Excalidraw plugin in Obsidian, he illustrates how to visualize the components of the Excalidraw interface and its functionalities. The video serves as a guide for viewers to understand the structure and elements within the Excalidraw plugin.

# Key Takeaways
- A brace map is used to show the parts of a whole, starting with the whole item and breaking it down into its components.
- The Excalidraw plugin in Obsidian features various components like a drawing canvas, a toolbar, and an options menu that can be further dissected.
- Understanding the structure of tools and features within the Excalidraw plugin can enhance your visual note-taking and organization skills.

Use a brace map when you want to show the parts of a whole. Start with the whole item on the left side and break it into parts on the right side. Let's explore how we could break the Excalidraw Obsidian plugin into its parts. I'll start by adding my Excalidraw icon on the left brace from my stencil library. [* ](https://youtu.be/rltMZP3U9d8?t=9)

So, Excalidraw has a drawing canvas; it has a toolbar at the top. There is a context-sensitive properties panel on the left, a zoom tool, undo/redo tools at the bottom, and built-in help. In addition to these core Excalidraw components, the plugin offers a couple of additional ones, such as the buttons in the title bar and the Excalidraw actions in the command palette.

In turn, the title bar buttons include the options menu with some additional functions. One of these functions is to switch to Markdown mode. When switching to Markdown mode, there is the front matter at the top of the document and the sections of the document, such as text elements, embedded files, and the drawing.

You could break down the toolbar into the lock, the core tools, and the stencil library. Then, the canvas could also be broken down to components such as the right-click context menu, which could feature different actions depending on the selected element on screen. [* ](https://youtu.be/rltMZP3U9d8?t=92)

And I almost forgot about the Excalidraw plugin settings, which feature lots of options to choose from, plus the Markdown features in the editor, such as links, transclusions, and support for LaTeX formulas. Though you could argue logic should rather be placed under the command palette. Finally, links can be internal links and internet links. [* ](https://youtu.be/rltMZP3U9d8?t=110)

This concludes the introduction of the brace map that you can use to explore the parts of a whole. In the next video, I will cover the flow map. Don't forget to subscribe so you are notified when part 6 is released. Thank you for watching. [* ](https://youtu.be/rltMZP3U9d8?t=138)
