![Part 5: Intro to Obsidian-Excalidraw - Stencil Library](https://youtu.be/rLx-9FvlzgI)

# Summary
In this video, the presenter introduces the stencil library feature in the Obsidian-Excalidraw plugin, detailing how to download and manage icon libraries. Viewers learn the steps to add, group, and delete objects from their personal libraries. The video concludes with a note on the future synchronization of libraries across devices.

# Key Takeaways
- The stencil library in Obsidian-Excalidraw allows users to browse and add various icon sets.
- Users can create and customize their own library of objects, making it easy to reuse designs.
- Currently, library management needs to be handled on each device separately, but synchronization is expected in future updates.

So welcome back, and this is part five of the introduction to the Excalidraw plugin in Obsidian. In this part, I want to introduce to you the stencil library. Here, if you click the library icon, you get this library of icons. Actually, you will get an empty set when you first open it. So what I want to show you is if you click "browse libraries," then this webpage comes up with the available libraries. Let's say I know there's this nice set of robots here I want to add. Don't click "add to Excalidraw," because that will direct you to a webpage that will just not work. But click "download." If you click "download," it will be saved to your downloads folder, and then if you come back... I closed the page, and if I come back here, I click "load," and here I can go and in my downloads, I can select the downloaded file. With that, I've added the objects to my library. From now on, if I want to use one of the objects, I click on the object, and I can place it in my document. [* ](https://youtu.be/rLx-9FvlzgI?t=1)

Now, what you can also do is create your own library of objects. So let's say I'm going to create this very silly object. I'm going to be distributing these horizontally, and I’m going to align them centrally and put them here. Let's just make sure that they have a background color. So let's say this is the object I want to add to my library. I select the object, I group my selection, so with this, I created a group. If I click on this, then I can choose "add to library," and from then on, this newly created object is available in my library. Similarly, if there’s an item that I want to remove from my library, let’s say I want to remove this object from my library, I can just simply click "delete," and that object is removed from my library.

And of course, if I create a new drawing, then in that new drawing as well, these objects are going to be available. Right now, you will need to manage your libraries on each of your devices separately. Eventually, once the settings are synchronized between your Obsidian instances on various devices, the library will synchronize as well. Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/rLx-9FvlzgI?t=180)
