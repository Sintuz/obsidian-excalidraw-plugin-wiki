![Connecting the Dots: Unleashing ExcaliBrain's Web-Linking Superpowers](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt presents a new feature in Excalibrain that enables the indexing of URLs and documents, significantly enhancing the way users can connect and navigate their notes. He demonstrates how this feature can be utilized to create meaningful links between different sources and notes, making it easier to organize and access information. Ultimately, Zsolt encourages viewers to explore the powerful capabilities of Excalibrain to boost their visual personal knowledge management.

# Key Takeaways
- The new indexing feature in Excalibrain allows users to integrate URLs and documents seamlessly into their note-taking workflow.
- Users can create connections between different notes based on shared references to external resources, facilitating a more interconnected thought process.
- Zsolt emphasizes the importance of user feedback and encourages experimentation with the updated Excalibrain features.

Hey everyone, Jolt here. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=0) I want to quickly demonstrate to you a new feature that I implemented in Excalibrain that I think is going to be game-changing. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=2) From now on, Excalibrain is going to index the URLs and documents as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=5) For example, you can see here that this is my note about free visual and communications resources, and this page is full of URLs. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=10) Now you can also see that some of these URLs‚Äîso for example, here this URL at the top has a data view field which functions as an ontology for this link. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=17) In my Excalibrain configuration, I've set up that the source ontology should be displayed above the node, so I can see that this page was the inspiration for the free visual and communications resources. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=41) I can also see that below the page, I have a whole bunch of links. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=63) I know which ones are the links because the links have this globe, and so I can navigate these links. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=67) The cool feature I want to show you is if I click here on the noun project, this is one of the resources. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=77) First of all, I get a web page that actually functions. So here, if I search for a car, for example, then this web page actually works. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=83) But what you can also note is that I have three references to this web page, and I want to talk about these for a second. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=95) The first reference I want to point out is the origin or the host. This is useful if, for example, you're linking to multiple Wikipedia articles or multiple Twitter tweets. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=104) In that case, you will have a page up here‚Äîmaybe we can look at my Wikipedia page later on‚Äîthat will connect all the Wikipedia pages across my world, and I can navigate based on the source. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=108) On the left-hand side, I can see two notes in my vault that reference this viewer here just now in the visual and communications resources page. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=132) You can take my word for it, but here amongst the links, the other link that I'm referencing here, the storyboard for the visual PKM training, is not represented. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=149) By having both of these pages linked to the same web page, I can connect the two thoughts, the two notes, and I can use these URLs as a way of linking my thinking in new ways. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=163) This page right here is a very busy page; this is the mind map that I shared with you in last week's video. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=178) You can see it has lots of links, but actually, the link to the free communications resources was not here. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=185) But because I have these URLs indexed, I can connect the two ideas. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=193) Now you can also search for URLs. So for example, I'm going to search for "linking your thinking." [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=199) If I click here, this is the host page, the root of the linking your thinking pages, and you can see that I have four references to various pages on linking your thinking. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=204) For example, I have this page for Vicky Zouz and failing session about the components of zato constant thinking, and under this, I have my own note. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=220) Up here amongst the sources, you will see that one of the sources is the LYT conference recording, which I can actually watch right here. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=235) So I have the YouTube embedded right here, and so this is another way to connect ideas. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=241) Finally, let's maybe look at Wikipedia and see how many items I have connected. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=249) You can see I have lots of connections to Wikipedia, but this is how you can use the host to connect your various documents that link to Wikipedia. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=255) I believe that this feature is game-changing because it gives you a new way to connect thoughts in your vault and a new way to search and interrogate your Obsidian vault. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=266) I know Excalibrain can be a bit intimidating; I've been putting some work into Excalibrain over the last couple of weeks, making it more stable, more user-friendly, as well as adding tons of features. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=279) For example, I've recently added the frame feature that we were using until now, but this is the legacy view of Excalibrain. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=297) I think with these developments, this might be the right time to give Excalibrain a try. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=306) Let me know in the comments what you found, how you found connections between your thoughts using links, and overall, I'd be interested to hear your feedback and comments and ideas regarding the tool. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=313) Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=324)

your various documents that link](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=261) [to the Wikipedia so I believe that this](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=263) [feature is game changing because this](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=266) [gives you a new way to connect thoughts](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=269) [in your Vault and gives you a new way to](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=272) [search and interrogate your obsidian](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=275) [vault](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=278) [so I know ex-coli brain can be a bit](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=279) [intimidating I've been putting some work](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=282) [into excalibrane over the last couple of](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=285) [weeks making it more stable more user](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=288) [friendly as well as adding tons of](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=291) [features so for example I've recently](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=294) [added the frame feature that we were](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=297) [using until now but this is the Legacy](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=300) [view of excalibrane I think with the](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=302) [links with these developments this might](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=306) [be the right time to give excalibrating](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=308) [a try and let me know in the comments](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=310) [what you found how you found connections](https://youtu.be/3TRymEIQgPI?t=313) [between your thoughts using links
