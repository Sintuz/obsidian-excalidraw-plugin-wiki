![Obsidian-Excalidraw 1.2.0 Walkthrough Part 3/10: Groups, layers, alignment and more](https://youtu.be/QOL1KF7-kdc)

# Summary
In this video, the presenter discusses advanced features of Excalidraw within Obsidian, focusing on groups, layers, and alignments. Viewers learn how to group objects for easier movement, manage object layers to control visibility, and align multiple elements for neat organization. The video concludes by highlighting a hidden feature that allows for the quick creation of simple charts from pasted datasets.

# Key Takeaways
- You can group objects in Excalidraw to move them together easily.
- Layers can be manipulated to control the order of visibility of objects in your drawing.
- Excalidraw provides alignment tools to properly position and distribute objects.
- It’s possible to copy objects as PNG or SVG files for use in other applications.
- Excalidraw supports the creation of simple charts from pasted data.

Hey and welcome back! This is part three of our series still talking about native Excalidraw features, now looking at some of the more advanced features: groups, layers, alignment, and more. So if I open this up and just pull this to the side, I will create a new empty document for us to work in. I'm going to change this to light mode and remove the grid. [* ](https://youtu.be/QOL1KF7-kdc?t=0)

So let's talk about groups. Let's say I have this box and I have this text saying "box," and I actually would like these to move together. So if I click here, I want the two to move together. That's very easy! I can select the two objects, and I can select group selection. With that, I can move my selection around. Let's color this maybe with a gray background, and I'll just make it fully filled. [* ](https://youtu.be/QOL1KF7-kdc?t=20)

Now, let's look at layers. Let's say I have this circle, and this circle is orange or yellow. If I now move this circle on top of the box, then you can see that the circle is over the box. However, under layers, I can send the circle back, and with that, I can manage different layers in my drawing. [* ](https://youtu.be/QOL1KF7-kdc?t=60)

Also, there's the option of aligning objects. If I select two objects, I can align them to the left. If I add a third object, for example, this diamond, then I can also distribute items vertically and center them horizontally. With that, you can set the alignment of these items. You can choose parts of your drawing. Maybe I want these two objects, and I’d like to copy them to a PNG or an SVG image. So I'm going to copy this now to PNG. [* ](https://youtu.be/QOL1KF7-kdc?t=100)

I can create a new document here, and if I hit Ctrl V, you can see that my two objects in PNG format were copied from Excalidraw. I can do the same; I can select my objects, Ctrl C to copy these objects, and if I open up excalidraw.com, I can paste these objects and work with them in Excalidraw or another Excalidraw window within Obsidian. [* ](https://youtu.be/QOL1KF7-kdc?t=136)

There's a hidden feature: Excalidraw supports some simple charts. So take this dataset here, for example. If I copy this dataset to the clipboard and then Ctrl V paste it into my drawing, Excalidraw offers to create charts that I can use. If I choose one of them and paste, you can see that my data was pasted, and this is a nice simple feature. [* ](https://youtu.be/QOL1KF7-kdc?t=175)

So those were all the more advanced features, and then next time, we're going to talk about the stencil library. [* ](https://youtu.be/QOL1KF7-kdc?t=213)
