Hey everyone, Zsolt here! It's been two years since I started to work on a Prezi-like slideshow experience using Obsidian Excalidraw, and in these two years, the slideshow script has gone through quite an evolution. Today, I'm releasing slideshow 3.0. This version comes with support for the new frame feature in Excalidraw, as well as a number of fixes and improvements to how you can control the slideshow. So I thought I would take the opportunity to give you a comprehensive walkthrough of what this script is capable of. [* ](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=0)

To get started, you will need to install the script from the script library, or if you have it installed already, you will need to update it. It's very simple to do; you need to click here on the Obsidian tools panel and choose the "Install or update Excalidraw scripts" function. When you open this, you will need to scroll down and find the slideshow script right here. If you have the slideshow installed, then you can already update the script by clicking this button. If you don't have it installed, you will need to click on the slideshow link, and here you will see the install button. So I'm going to update my slideshow script by pressing this button, and you can see the message that the script was updated. Now that I have updated the script, let me jump back to our presentation. [* ](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=21)

The way I can create a presentation is by simply drawing on the infinite canvas of Obsidian Excalidraw. So we are going to be using this simple drawing for our demonstration purposes, and you can imagine that similarly to this, you can arrange whatever drawing you want, like the mind map I'm presenting on the other screen. Once your drawing is ready, you will need to set up your slides, and there are two ways you can do that: you can draw an arrow marking the slide order, or you can add frames. The arrows have been supported since version one, but the frames are a new feature. So let's first look at how you would add arrows. [* ](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=40)

If I come over to my drawing right here, let me just demonstrate how this works to you. First of all, I need to select the arrow tool, and with the arrow tool, I like to set the line to be solid, the sloppiness to be architect edges, the edges to be sharp, and the stroke width to be thin. Then I can start drawing the way I draw. I click the mouse button at the top left of the first frame, and then I drag the mouse. I'm not holding the mouse button down, so I'm just simply dragging the mouse. When I click again, I can add an additional point. This way, I can click, drag, click, drag, and I can simply set up my four slides in the sequence as I want to present them. When I'm at the end, I double-click, and with that, my line is finished. This is going to be my presentation path, so if I select this line and now select the presentation button right here, then you will see that I move first to the first slide, then to the second slide, then to the third slide, and finally the fourth slide. You will also notice that I have the slide numbers here, so I can simply switch back to the first slide if I want. [* ](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=101)

If I want to change my presentation, then I have a couple of options. First of all, to change your presentation, you need to adjust the line. How do you do that? You can click on the line, then you need to control double-click, meaning you hold down the control key and double-click on the line, and with this, you enter the line editing mode. Alternatively, you can enter the line editor by right-clicking on the line and selecting "Edit line." Now you can pick up these big circles and simply move the position of these circles to adjust the framing of the slide. You can also add new slides. For example, you can see these midway blobs here; if I pick up one of these, I'm creating a new breakpoint in the line, and if I create two new breakpoints, then I can create a new slide. This new slide is going to zoom in on these two people sitting here, and I can add another slide, maybe zooming in on the UFO, like this. Now if I start my presentation, you will notice that I have six slides, and I can simply move on with my slides. By the way, you can either use these buttons to progress the slides, or you can use the left and right arrows on your keyboard. You can see that as we modified the slideshow, now we have these additional slides added. [* ](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=243)

There's a different way as well how you can edit slides. If you want to edit this slide, then you can activate the control panel right here. If you click the "Edit slide" button, then what's going to happen is automatically the line enters into the line editing mode, and the two points are selected that define the frame that you were talking about. Now I know which two points I need to update, and I can do my updates however I want. If I want to delete these, I can equally just simply delete the points from here, like this, and now I have removed this slide from the slideshow. If I now come back and do my presentation, you will see that I only have five slides, and I no longer have the second zoom slide, which has already moved to the last slide in my slideshow. [* ](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=427)

Additionally, you will notice that now that I have this slideshow, I have these lines over my drawing, which is not very practical, as the drawing looks awful with these lines on it and, furthermore, when I draw, these lines are in the way. There's a solution for that! If I open the slideshow, then you will notice that I have a toggle here. This toggle button will hide the line. If I turn this on, I'll also see this message that now the line is hidden; it's no longer accessible. After I finish the presentation, you will see that the line is gone, it’s not visible; it's not selectable. In reality, it's there in the background with a transparent color, and it's locked. If you click carefully, you can unlock it and change the color if you want. Normally, it's not in the way; you cannot select it, it's just hidden in the background. If you have a hidden line in a drawing, then all you need to do is click the slideshow button, and the slideshow will start. So you don't need to select the line to start the slideshow; you can simply click the slideshow button, and the slideshow will begin. If I make this visible again and finish the presentation, then you will see that I have my presentation line here. [* ](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=529)

Now I'm going to delete these lines and show you how you can use frames to define your presentation. For that, you have this "More tools" button right here, and you need to select the frame tool. Or you can also notice that the "F" key is going to be a shortcut for this tool. I'm going to choose this frame tool and create frame one. Then, pressing "F," I'm going to create frame two. Pressing "F" again, I'm going to create frame three, and finally frame four. Now, I have frames on a drawing, and if I start the presentation, then it is going to present the frames. You can see that again I have four slides. Notice that the "Edit slide" option and also the toggle to hide the slide have appeared because frames cannot be hidden, and frames don't need a tool to edit. Editing the frame is pretty simple. If I just resize the frame and add maybe a circle right here, and now I start my presentation, then my second slide will show that image and the circle. It was a pretty simple step to do the editing like this. [* ](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=532)

The sequence of the slides will depend on the name of the frames. You will notice here that the frames have names: frame one, frame two, frame three, and frame four. What Excalidraw's slideshow script does is it takes these frame titles and puts them in alphabetical order. For example, if I rename this to frame three and I rename this to frame four, then in alphabetical order, I change the sequence of these two slides. When I start my presentation, you will see that slide three is now this slide, and slide four is this slide. This is pretty simple to change your sequence. Finally, there's one more button here, which is the toggle full-screen button. If I press this, you will not really see much because I have a much bigger screen than the recorded area, but this will take the slideshow into full-screen mode. If I press the button again, then it will collapse it to be within the window. [* ](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=675)

In summary, we talked about setting up slides, creating arrows, and starting the presentation. Importantly, if you're using arrows, you need to select the line as that will be the presentation path. If the arrow is hidden, just click the presentation button, and Excalidraw will automatically find the hidden button. If you have frames, again, just press the presentation button, and the slideshow will begin. However, there's a specific sequence of logic that the script follows when looking for frames. Let me just show you that. Now I'm going to add a line and create it like this, where this will be slide one, and this will be slide two. Now that I've added this line, if I select the line and start my presentation, it will show the first two frames followed by the second two frames. But if I start my presentation without selecting the line, it will present slide one and then slide two. Of course, the line is not hidden, so the script doesn't know whether this is a normal arrow that you want in your drawing or if it's a sequence of a slide. The important point here is to keep in mind that if you're using multiple ways to define slides, this is the sequence in which the script will look for those slides in your file. Depending on this logic, one or the other type of frames will be used. [* ](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=759)

Finally, here's the control panel we already looked at. You have a new control panel with forward and backward buttons, a slide selector, toggle for full-screen and view mode, and those two controls that are only visible if you're using arrows. You can use this toggle to hide the arrow after presentation, and you can untoggle it to show the arrow again after the presentation. There's a pen to edit the line points for the current slide being shown, and you also have an end presentation button. Additionally, you can drag the panel. Let me show you this final feature. When I turn on this presentation, you will see that I can click and drag my presentation panel. You also notice that the presentation panel will become almost transparent if it's inactive, while it will become active when you move your mouse over it or click on it. And that's all I wanted to show you today! I hope you will enjoy this new feature. Let me know in the comments. I still have ideas of what to do; for example, a slide sorter would be awesome as an addition. But I would also be interested in your ideas on where you would take the slideshow capability next. Thank you! [* ](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=883)

click the mouse button at the top](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=180) [left of the first frame and then I drag](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=183) [the mouse I'm not holding the mouse](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=187) [button now so I'm just simply dragging](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=189) [the mouse and then when I click again](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=192) [then I can add an additional point and](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=195) [this way I can click drag click drag and](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=198) [I can simply set up my four slides

first slide then to the second slide](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=228) [third slide and fourth slide you will](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=231) [also notice that I have the slide](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=235) [numbers here so I can simply switch back](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=237) [to the first slide if I want](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=240) [now](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=242) [if I want to change my presentation then](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=243) [I have couple of options first of all to](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=247) [change your presentation you need to](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=251) [adjust the line how do you do that you](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=253) [can click on the line and then you need](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=256) [to control double click so you hold down](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=259) [the control key and you double click on](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=262) [the line and with this you enter the](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=265) [line editing mode equally you can enter](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=269) [the line editor by simply right clicking](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=271) [on the line and selecting edit line and](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=276) [with that again you will be in the line](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=279) [editor mode](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=282) [so now you can](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=284) [pick up these big](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=286) [circles and you can simply move the](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=288) [position of those circles to adjust the](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=291) [framing of the slide as well as you can](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=294) [add new slides so for example](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=297) [you can see these Midway blobs here if I](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=300) [pick up one of these then I'm creating a](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=305) [new breakpoint in the line and if I](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=308) [create two new breakpoints then I can](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=312) [create a new slide and this new slide is](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=315) [going to zoom in on these two people](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=318) [sitting here and I can add another slide](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=320) [maybe zooming in on the UFO like this so](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=323) [now if I start my presentation then you](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=329) [will notice that now I have six slides](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=332) [and I can simply move on with my slides](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=335) [by the way you can either use these](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=339) [buttons to progress the slides you can](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=341) [see that I zoomed into these two people](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=344) [or I can use on my keyboard the left and](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=346) [right arrows and you can see that as we](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=351) [modified the slideshow now we have these](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=354) [additional slides added now there's a](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=357) [different way as well how you can edit](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=361) [slides so if you want to edit this slide](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=363) [then you can activate the control panel](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=365) [right here and if you click the edit](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=369) [slide button then what's going to happen](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=372) [is automatically the line enters into](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=376) [the line editing mode and the two points](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=379) [are selected that Define the frame that](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=383) [you were talking about and now I know](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=387) [which two points I need to update and I](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=390) [can do my updates the way I want to do](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=392) [that or if I want to delete these I can](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=396) [equally](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=399) [just simply delete the points from here](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=401) [like this and now I removed this slide](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=404) [from the slideshow so again if now I](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=408) [come back and do my presentation you](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=411) [will see that I only have five slides](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=413) [and I no longer have the second Zoom](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=416) [slide it already moves to the last slide](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=420) [in my slideshow](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=423) [now additionally](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=425) [you will notice that now that I have](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=427) [this slideshow I have these lines over](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=431) [my drawing which is not very practical](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=433) [a the drawing looks awful because it has](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=437) [these lines on it and B then I draw I](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=440) [this these lines are in the way](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=443) [so there's a solution for that if I open](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=446) [the slideshow then you will notice that](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=449) [I have a toggle here and this toggle](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=452) [button will](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=456) [hide the line if I turn this on I'll](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=458) [also see this message that now the line](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=461) [is hidden it's no longer accessible then](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=464) [I finish the presentation so I'm going](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=468) [to finish the presentation you will see](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=470) [that the line is gone it's not visible](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=473) [it's not selectable](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=475) [in reality it's there in the background](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=478) [with a transparent color and it's locked](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=481) [so if you click carefully then you can](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=483) [unlock it and you can change the color](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=487) [if you want you need to right click but](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=489) [normally it's not in the way you cannot](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=491) [select it it's just hidden in the](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=494) [background and if you have a hidden line](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=497) [in a drawing then all you need to do is](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=500) [you just need to click the slideshow](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=503) [button and the slideshow will start so](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=505) [you don't need to select the line to](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=508) [start the slideshow you can just simply](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=511) [click the slideshow button and the](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=513) [slideshow will begin so now if I make](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=515) [this visible again and finish the](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=518) [presentation then you will see that I](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=521) [have my presentation line here](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=524) [so that's about lines now I'm going to](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=527) [delete these lines and I'm going to show](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=529) [you](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=531) [how you can use frames to Define your](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=532) [presentation so for that you have this](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=536) [more tools button right here and you](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=540) [need to select the frame tool or you can](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=544) [also notice that the F key is going to](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=546) [be a shortcut for this tool so I'm going](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=550) [to just simply choose this tool the](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=553) [frame tool and I'm going to create frame](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=556) [one and then pressing the F I'm going to](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=559) [create Frame 2 and pressing F I'm going](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=563) [to create frame 3 and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=566) [create frame 4 and then I have frames on](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=569) [a drawing and I start the presentation](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=574) [then it is going to present the frames](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=578) [and you can see that again I have four](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=581) [slides but also notice that the edit](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=584) [slide and also the toggle to hide the](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=587) [slide have disappear appeared because](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=591) [frames you cannot hide and frames you](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=593) [don't need this tool to edit because to](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=596) [edit the frame it is pretty simple so if](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=599) [I just simply resize the frame and I add](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=602) [maybe a circle right here and now I](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=605) [start my presentation then you will see](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=609) [that my second slide is going to be that](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=611) [image and the circle so it was a pretty](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=615) [simple step to do the editing like this](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=617) [the sequence of the slides will depend](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=623) [on the name of the frames so you will](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=626) [notice here](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=629) [that the frames have names frame one](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=630) [frame two frame three frame frame four](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=633) [and what x color draw the slideshow](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=636) [script does is it takes these frame](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=639) [titles and puts them in alphabetical](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=642) [order so for example if I rename this to](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=644) [frame three](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=648) [and I rename this to frame four so in](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=649) [alphabetical order I change the sequence](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=653) [of these two slides](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=656) [then if I start my presentation you will](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=658) [see that slide 3 is now this slide and](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=662) [slide four is this slide so this is](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=666) [pretty simple to change your sequence](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=669) [and finally there's one more button here](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=673) [which is the toggle full screen button](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=675) [if I press this you will not really see](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=680) [much because I have a much bigger screen](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=683) [than the recorded area but this will](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=685) [take the slideshow into full screen mode](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=688) [and if I press then the button again](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=690) [then it will collapse it to be within](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=693) [the window](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=696) [so getting back to our presentation I](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=698) [think we've covered everything but let's](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=701) [just make sure that indeed that is the](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=703) [case I'm going to jump to slide 9 so we](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=706) [talked about setting up slides we talked](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=710) [about how you can create arrows and then](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=712) [we also talked about starting the](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=716) [presentation now this is important so if](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=719) [you're using arrows you need to select](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=723) [the line and that is going to be the](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=726) [presentation path if the arrow is hidden](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=729) [then you just click the presentation](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=733) [button and X call it raw will](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=735) [automatically find the hidden button and](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=737) [if you have frames then simply again you](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=740) [just press the presentation button and](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=743) [the slideshow will begin](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=746) [however there's a sequence of logic how](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=748) [the script looks for the frames and let](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=752) [me just show you that so now I'm going](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=756) [to add a line as well and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=759) [create it like this that this is going](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=763) [to be slide one and this is going to be](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=766) [slide 2 like this so now I've added this](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=771) [line if I select the line and I start my](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=775) [presentation then it's going to show the](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=779) [first two frames and the second two](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=783) [frames but if I start my presentation](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=786) [without selecting the line then](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=790) [it is actually going to present slide](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=793) [one and then slide two and of course the](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=797) [line is not hidden because](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=801) [the script doesn't know if this is a](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=803) [normal arrow that you want on your](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=806) [drawing or if it's a sequence of a slide](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=808) [so the important Point here is to keep](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=812) [in mind that if you're using multiple](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=815) [ways to Define slides then this is the](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=818) [sequence in which the script is going to](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=822) [look for those slides in your file and](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=825) [depending on this logic one or the other](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=829) [type of frames are going to be used](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=833) [and then finally this is the control](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=836) [panel we already looked at it so you](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=839) [have a new control panel with forward](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=842) [and backwards button you have a slide](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=844) [selector you have the toggle full screen](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=847) [and View mode you have these two](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=850) [controls that are only visible if you're](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=853) [using arrows and you can use this toggle](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=856) [to hide the arrow after presentation and](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=859) [you can untoggle it to show the arrow](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=862) [after presentation](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=865) [and you have the pen to edit the line](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=867) [points for the current slide being shown](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=870) [and then you have the end presentation](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=873) [Button as well as you can also drag the](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=876) [panel so let me just show you this final](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=880) [feature I'm going to turn this](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=883) [presentation on and you will see that](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=886) [here I can click and drag my](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=889) [presentation panel you also notice that](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=892) [the presentation panel will become](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=895) [almost transparent if it's inactive and](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=898) [it will become active when you move your](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=902) [mouse over it or you click on this](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=905) [and that's all I wanted to show you](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=909) [today I hope you will enjoy this new](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=912) [feature and let me know in the comments](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=915) [I still have ideas what to do so for](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=918) [example a slide sorter would be awesome](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=921) [as an addition but I would be also](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=924) [interested in your ideas of where would](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=928) [you take the slideshow capability next](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=931) [thank you](https://youtu.be/JwgtCrIVeEU?t=935)
