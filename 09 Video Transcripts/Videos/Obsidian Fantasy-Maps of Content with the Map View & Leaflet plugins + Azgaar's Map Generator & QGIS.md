# Content
Since publishing my last video about using the map view as the location index for my vault, I fell down the rabbit hole of maps. I wanted to see what it would be like to replace the folder structure of my vault with a fantasy map where my notes are pins on the world of Obsidian. The end result is what you could call a fantasy map of contents. While I'm not convinced that this is very practical, it captures my imagination. In the end, I believe that true creativity can only happen when we are playing, and a map can help us make connections between notes and ideas using our visual brain. I hope this video will inspire you to experiment with visual tools for making your Obsidian vault more colorful, engaging, and overall more fun. [* ](https://youtu.be/rL6y25o__Hs?t=0)

I had a lot of fun working on this concept. I also learned a lot about mapping tools and the Map View and the Obsidian Leaflet plugins. In this video, I will show you how to create your own map with Azgaar's Map Generator and how to make it available in Obsidian. I will focus on the Map View plugin and show you how to generate map tiles using QGIS and how to host these styles with GitHub Pages. I will also briefly show you the Obsidian Leaflet plugin. There are two benefits to the Leaflet plugin: one, you can have multiple different maps in your repository while with Map View you are limited to one; and second, you can skip the creation of map tiles and directly use the map image, though this approach will result in slower performance. [* ](https://youtu.be/rL6y25o__Hs?t=54)

This video is long already, so I will need to move the detailed comparison of Map View and Obsidian Leaflet to the next video. Before we dive into the how, let's talk a bit about the why. Here's an example use case: if you're working on documents, you're probably managing some form of a content creation workflow. This will typically include stages such as idea, research, draft, review, and publish—maybe more. Now imagine the Silk Road of content publishing. Your documents are pins on the map instead of changing their statuses or moving them from column to column on a Kanban board; you can move the pins along the Silk Road as you would move game pieces on a game board. [* ](https://youtu.be/rL6y25o__Hs?t=110)

Because of our evolutionary ancestry, our spatial orientation skills are very strong. Using a map as a visual workflow, you can tap into your visual brain. Imagine another use case: your vault is the vast unexplored land of knowledge. As you learn new information, you place documents representing this knowledge as pins on a map. As you explore new areas, you discover new parts of the map where you build new cities of knowledge. By exploring the tools I will show you in the rest of the video, you can create an ever-evolving fantasy map of your own mind—a fantasy map of contents. [* ](https://youtu.be/rL6y25o__Hs?t=176)

Let's open Azgaar's Fantasy Map Generator. In the next few minutes, I'm going to use quite a few different tools; don't worry, I've included all the links in the video description. The map generator will open with a random map. I will click the arrow button in the top left of the screen to open the map configuration panel. We'll make a few changes to the settings. You may follow the settings I am applying or experiment with settings of your own. I will first head over to the options and set the number of map points. The higher this number, the smoother and more detailed the map, but this will also increase the load on your PC, so if your machine is slower, keep this number unchanged or set it to a lower number than the maximum. You can select a map template as well; this will determine the general layout of the land. I've set this earlier to shattered, and I will leave it unchanged for now. [* ](https://youtu.be/rL6y25o__Hs?t=206)

I have also increased the number of states earlier, so I'm not touching it now, but it is also something you may want to play with for a more interesting map. On the layers tab, you can configure what to show on the map. I have a preset for just nature; I will add provinces and labels. When I click on new map, the map generator will create a random map based on my settings. Depending on the number of points and the resolution of your screen, this will take a few seconds to complete. When the map is ready, I click the toggle to hide the menu and click one of the states to edit its name. I will not change the font size now, but in case you would want that, you'd need to click this button to access font properties. [* ](https://youtu.be/rL6y25o__Hs?t=270)

In the meantime, I'm going to change the name of a few other states as well. Notice how the pipe character indicates a line break in the name. Finally, I'm going to add a route to the map. You can do that by clicking the tools menu and selecting the route at the bottom. You can create the route simply by clicking the locations along the path you'd like to follow. You can create your own Silk Road of content creation or whatever workflow you'd like to track. I'm going to open the line properties window to set the width of the line a little thicker. Note, however, that all objects have a type, thus when I change the thickness of the line, all my routes will show thicker on the map. If you want to edit the same map later, you can save it to disk, to Dropbox, or to your web browser's memory. [* ](https://youtu.be/rL6y25o__Hs?t=324)

We will need to export two files from the map generator: an image of the map, typically a PNG file, and the cell information in GeoJSON format. Before exporting the image, set the image scale to a higher number depending on your screen’s resolution. The scale will result in different image sizes. As a general rule, the larger the scale, the better quality the image, but the bigger the file and the slower the process; you may need to wait a minute or more for the file to be generated. I have an ultra-wide screen; scale 8 took about a minute to be generated, and the resulting image file was almost 100 megabytes large. In this case, the resulting image has a resolution of roughly 7700 by 4000. [* ](https://youtu.be/rL6y25o__Hs?t=393)

If you need better resolution, you can also download the image in tiles. In this case, however, you will need to do a bit more work later, as you will need to geo-reference each tile separately. The tiles will be downloaded in a ZIP file; this will also take a while. Finally, I want to show you one more thing: under options, you can configure the world. This means specifying the part of the globe your map should cover. I did not have good experience creating a map that covers the whole world; it was very distorted. You will achieve the least distortion if you choose the tropical region as I did. The best way to find out which one is best for you is by trying a couple of versions. [* ](https://youtu.be/rL6y25o__Hs?t=456)

Now we will jump over to QGIS to create the map tiles. Installing QGIS is very straightforward; I simply clicked "download now" on the QGIS webpage and followed instructions. In QGIS, we will add two layers: first, a vector layer using the cells GeoJSON we exported earlier, then an image layer that we will create by adding georeference to our exported image. If you want to play with the map, you can also import the other vector files available in Azgaar's Map Generator, but that is a lengthier and more complicated process. We will skip that for today. [* ](https://youtu.be/rL6y25o__Hs?t=488)

Once the vector layer is loaded, I will open the selected features by value dialog and filter on type ocean and condition equal to. When I click the select features button, you will see that all the ocean cells on my map turn yellow. I am removing the ocean cells to make the geo-referencing process simpler. Next, we will do geo-referencing. You will find this tool in the raster menu. Let's load the exported image file. Geo-referencing means that you identify points on the image with points on the map. This way, the software can calculate how to distort the image to fit the selected geographical area. I'm looking for easy-to-recognize features on the image map and the vector map and using the geo-referencer tool. I first click the point on the image, then click to identify the corresponding point on the map. I try to identify five to six points evenly distributed west to east and north to south. [* ](https://youtu.be/rL6y25o__Hs?t=531)

When I'm done, I press the transformation button, and I'm reminded that I did not specify the transformation type. I recommend setting the transformation type to polynomial 1 and selecting the target spatial reference system using the project's coordinate reference system. When we are happy with the settings, we can click run again. The transformation may take a while. This time the image is small, but with a larger image, the resulting GeoTIFF file was one gigabyte large. We can now close the geo-referencer; you may save the reference points, but I don't think we'll use them again, so I'll discard them. Now we can add the newly created GeoTIFF file as a raster layer to our map. The raster image has loaded nicely on top of the vectors; I will hide the vectors as they are hidden behind the raster image anyway. [* ](https://youtu.be/rL6y25o__Hs?t=640)

All that is left for us to do in QGIS is to generate the map tiles that will feed into our map plugin in Obsidian. The processing toolbox is under the processing menu; choose generate XYZ tiles to directory from raster tools. This will slice our map into small pieces with different zoom levels. The map plugin will dynamically load the required tiles depending on the visible area and the zoom level. The extent is the area for which we want the tiles to be created. Use our raster layer to define the extent. Set minimum zoom to 1 and maximum zoom to 10. Higher zoom levels will take exponentially longer to produce, and depending on your computer, QGIS might simply run out of memory and slow to a grinding halt. I’m going to set the DPI for the tiles to 300 to ensure I have sharp looking tiles. I'm leaving the file format as PNG and will set the output folder. After hitting run, depending on your settings, it may take hours to produce the tiles. I recommend setting max zoom to a low number first as you learn and experiment with the process. [* ](https://youtu.be/rL6y25o__Hs?t=724)

While we are waiting for the map tiles, let's create a project on GitHub. I will use GitHub Pages to host the tiles. If you have other means to host a website, that is equally good. Public repositories on GitHub are free, thus it seems like a reasonable choice for this purpose. Click new and type in a repository name. Add a README file; you need the README because then GitHub will automatically create a main branch in your repository, and you won't need to deal with creating a branch separately. Click create repository. In our new repository under settings, I'm going to select pages to activate GitHub Pages for this project. This will configure GitHub to host my files on the internet. I select the main branch and click save. I also choose a template, though this step may be omitted. [* ](https://youtu.be/rL6y25o__Hs?t=757)

Going back to settings, I can check the address of my new website. Don't worry; it will take a few minutes until the content is available on the site. Now I need to clone this repository onto my PC so I can upload the map tiles. Click code, then code again, and select open with GitHub Desktop. If you don't have GitHub Desktop installed, GitHub will guide you through the process to get it installed. In the meantime, QGIS is ready with the map tiles. Let's move these tiles into my GitHub folder locally. I will create a map folder in the root folder of my repository and save the generated map files to that location. Finally, I need to open the repository in GitHub and click commit to main. [* ](https://youtu.be/rL6y25o__Hs?t=834)

Note that we are handling a very large number of files here; it took GitHub Desktop a minute until it responded to the commit button, and then it took four hours to complete the commit operation. When the commit operation finally finishes, you can push the files to GitHub by pressing the push origin button. This, again, will take time; we are moving a large volume of data here. Speed will largely depend on your network bandwidth as well. Once the push to origin is complete, we can proceed to configure the tile server in the Map View plugin. I will first test if the tiles are really available by following the link in GitHub settings. Our map tiles are in the map folder. Let's try to see if the first tile is available. It should be under 111.png, and yes, the map tile is there. [* ](https://youtu.be/rL6y25o__Hs?t=890)

Let's copy the part of the address from https until the numbers. Now we will switch to Obsidian to open the Map View settings window. We need to change the URL under map source advanced. If you're having trouble, I will include the value for the setting in the video description. And that is it; our fantasy map is now available in Map View after I close and reopen Map View. Finally, let me just briefly show you how you can configure the Leaflet plugin to display an image and also to use the GitHub-based map tile server. Note how I have set the OSM layer to false to avoid displaying the world map in the background. I have also set min and max zoom levels based on the map tiles I have available. The coordinate system of the map is a geographical coordinate system. When using an image, the latitude and longitude values become percentages of the complete image, a value between 1 and 100. The default value of 50-50 will focus the map at its center. [* ](https://youtu.be/rL6y25o__Hs?t=960)

You also have the option of using an SVG export, which will result in nicer-looking graphics. As I move around the two maps, the one working off of the map tile server definitely feels smoother to pan and to zoom. However, there isn't such a significant difference in performance. Thus, if you use the Leaflet plugin, then you are probably better off skipping the whole complexity of creating map tiles and simply using an SVG image. As a final note, you could also use Excalidraw to draw your map. You can save the Excalidraw image as an SVG and feed it to the Leaflet plugin in a similar way as you did with the fantasy map. If you plan on changing your Excalidraw map as your map idea evolves, I advise setting a clear boundary for the map with a rectangle right at the beginning. That way, every time you export the map, the size of the exported image will stay constant. This is important because if the size of the image changes, pins will move out of place on the map.

So that is all for today. I hope you learned something, as well as I hope I was able to inspire you to create a fantasy map of content for yourself. Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/rL6y25o__Hs?t=1082)
