![Playing to Win: Strategy Worksheet - Book on a Page](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt presents his book-on-a-page summary and a strategy worksheet based on Roger L. Martin's book "Playing to Win: How Strategy Really Works." He highlights the misconceptions about strategy and outlines an effective strategic cascade consisting of five key choices. The video encourages viewers to rethink their approach to strategy and provides a downloadable worksheet for practical application.

# Key Takeaways
- Strategy is not merely an aspiration or plan but involves an integrated set of choices.
- The five elements of the Strategic Cascade include winning aspirations, where to play, how to win, core capabilities, and management systems.
- Practicing strategic thinking involves recognizing common pitfalls, such as the "do it all" strategy, and focusing on creating unique capabilities that are hard to replicate.

Hey everyone, Jolt here. Today is the final closeout session of cohort 6 of the visual thinking workshop, where we all read "Playing to Win: How Strategy Really Works" by Roger L. Martin, and we all created our book-on-a-page summaries. This video is going to be a demonstration of my book-on-a-page summary, which this time around is more of a worksheet—a strategy worksheet that you can download and fill out for yourself. I’ve actually given this a test drive; I went through and filled out this worksheet with material about my online business, and I found it a super useful exercise. So, if you follow the video, you'll understand the basic concepts from the book as well as how to fill out this worksheet, and you can also download the worksheet from a link in the video description.

Now, before we dive into what strategy is and how it works, let's talk about some of the ineffective ways and approaches to strategy. The first ineffective approach is treating strategy as a vision or stopping at the vision level. A vision is not yet a strategy; it’s an important part of the strategy but not the strategy alone. Equally, people talk about strategic plans, which, according to Roger, are really not a good term; a plan is not a strategy. As you can see in the bottom right corner, a detailed plan may actually not add up to a long-term, sustainable competitive advantage. Also, benchmarking to others and trying to imitate others in the industry is not a strategy; sameness is not a strategy. Following best practices or trying to do everything at the same time won’t lead to effective strategy either. Lastly, Roger makes the point that the idea that the business and the world are changing so fast that we are unable to create a strategy—resulting in an emergent strategy—is flawed; the more uncertain the situation, the more you need a strategy, because that strategy will guide decisions on how you approach your business. [* ](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=30)

In the book, Roger talks about the Strategic Cascade, which essentially defines strategy as an integrated and coordinated set of five choices, starting with defining your winning aspirations, then talking about where to play and how to play. Once these are defined, you can move on to discuss core capabilities and finally the management systems that will help you stay on track with your strategy. As you can see from the arrows here and from the spiral in the top right, strategy is an iterative process; it's about thinking about one aspect of the strategy and then revisiting another part of your strategy to ensure that these parts work in concert with each other. It’s about choices, and as you make your choices, you narrow down your options and arrive at a strategy. Another point to highlight is that if you're talking about a big organization—of course, if you're a one-man shop, that’s different—but in a big organization, strategy happens at multiple layers. These strategic cascades will affect one another; they will build on one another, and you need to consider that cascading effect as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=60)

Now let’s look at each of these five steps in the cascade. We’ll explore some of the best practices outlined in the book, starting with winning aspirations. First of all, you should craft a deep, purpose-driven aspiration—something that is really close to your heart. You should start that aspiration not from a product perspective but from a customer perspective; customers should be at the center when you're playing, and you should aspire to win, not just to play. Here, I'd like to mention in brackets that I recommend reading "The Infinite Game" by Simon Sinek as well as "Finite and Infinite Games" by James P. Carse. I’m not sure I fully agree with the statements made by Roger here; defining the rules of the game unilaterally and determining based on what criteria I'm going to win is not truly winning. However, I understand the idea in the book that you shouldn't simply be playing around. If you're in business, you should aim to make a difference; you should strive to win in the areas you’ve selected to participate in. As you consider winning and strategizing, be mindful of unexpected competitors and think about cascading your aspirations down to your functions, brands, and product lines—again, if you’re in a large organization. Lastly, don't stop here: aspirations are not yet strategy; they’re just the first step in defining your strategy. [* ](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=128)

Once you have your aspirations clear, then you can think about where you want to play. "Where" is a broad term, which can refer to geography, supply chains, customer segments, distribution channels, or customer needs. There are many ways to define where you want to play, but you need to be clear about it and seek niches where you can win. This means that you want to look for the path of least resistance; you want to compete smartly. Avoid opening multiple fronts; don’t attack an established strong player head-on, and always be cautious when you find a niche that seems empty—there is probably someone you just didn’t notice because you were not familiar with it. Finally, choosing to play everywhere is not a choice; if you do that, then you haven't made a real decision. You cannot be successful playing everywhere. Once you know where you want to play, you need to think about how you want to win. You’ll need to create choices, and we’ll talk about these choices later on in the reverse engineering part, which we’ll cover in just a couple of minutes. If you're unable to create winning choices, then it’s time to exit that game and search for another. As you think about how to win, make sure it aligns with where to play. For instance, if you decide to play in the premium segment of your customer base, then a strategy of low-cost sales and promotions may not be the right approach. You’ll likely need to build brand prestige and do other things that align with that. [* ](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=259)

As you consider how to play, be aware that the dynamics of the game may change—your competitors are also playing, so you must always keep your eyes open to track changes in the competitive landscape. If you're not succeeding, go back and reassess the rules; modify them in a way that will enable you to win. When thinking about how to win, remember to consider your non-customer-facing business units as well and your functions. Once you know your aspirations and where to play, and how to play, then you need to define your core capabilities. These are essential capabilities that are consistent across your organization and that build upon one another. Don’t overthink this: if something seems critical, then it likely is critical. The important thing, as emphasized in the book, is to create a unique set of capabilities. Your aspirations and choices about where to play and how to play can be easily imitated by competitors, but your core capabilities are extremely difficult to replicate; that’s your long-term competitive advantage. Make sure you develop a unique system. As you build your unique system, reverse engineer the activity systems of your competitors and ensure that you have a better system. When evaluating your own capabilities, conduct a realistic assessment and perform feasibility tests, so you’re not blindsided when you go out into the real world to execute your capabilities. [* ](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=430)

Finally, you need to create management systems that keep you on track with your strategic journey. This means establishing a rhythm for discussing strategy and revisiting your choices. Maintain very clear and simple communication with your organization so everyone understands what the strategy is. You want to create metrics to measure your development of capabilities, as well as metrics that evaluate your strategic choices. In summary, these are the five elements of the Strategic Cascade. In addition to these five elements, the book contains two additional valuable resources. One is the logic flow, which simplifies the process of thinking through segmentation, structure, customer, and channel capabilities and costs, as well as anticipating how competitors are likely to react and creating strategic choices based on this assessment. The other tool in the book is called reverse engineering, which involves framing issues as choices. Roger emphasizes that unless you're able to create a choice out of an issue, it won’t be clear to people what the issue really is. Therefore, it’s important to try to frame your issues as choices, generate strategic possibilities for those choices, and return to the core question of "what would have to be true?" We will revisit that question shortly. Once you've identified what would have to be true for each of these strategic possibilities, you then need to pinpoint the barriers to each and define tests for how you can test these barriers. Start executing these tests by beginning with the weakest barrier first, as doing so will help quickly filter out infeasible options that fail the initial test. [* ](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=667)

In terms of the question of "what would have to be true," this revelation was significant for Roger, and he discusses it at length in the book. Instead of arguing about what is true and what is not, it’s much more productive to explore what would have to be true. This means taking a strategic possibility and analyzing the logic flow backwards. You consider how your competitors might react, what they’re going to do, and then think about what needs to be true about your capabilities, costs, channels, customers, etc., for this strategic option to be viable. You then work backwards based on this logic to validate different strategic possibilities. Now, let’s discuss how to fill out this form. It’s very straightforward: fill in the table following the sequence of numbers. Start with winning aspirations, then move on to where to play, and so forth. We will take a closer look at this in just a moment, but as you fill this out, use the logic flow and the reverse engineering tools to guide your thinking. How does this work? You start by defining your winning aspirations under point number one and, once you've defined them, you move on to think about where to play, considering customer segments, geography, products, etc. After deciding where to play, revisit your winning aspirations and jot down any additional insights or modifications that arise regarding them. When that's complete, proceed to how to win, filling out your ideas about your choices, triggering another reevaluation of where to play and your aspirations, and so on. This is how you navigate through this worksheet—all the time retracing your steps to refine your aspirations, where to play, how to play, etc. [* ](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=804)

There are six traps that you should aim to avoid. Avoid the “do it all” strategy; it simply will not work. Avoid attacking walled cities, meaning don’t assault established strong players or open multiple fronts, as this will not lead to victory. Don't attempt to meet everyone’s requirements, as you cannot play in all geographies and customer segments all at once; this will lead to dissatisfaction for both you and your customers. Do not develop aspirations that you cannot transform into strategic choices. Lastly, steer clear of the "program of the month" approach, where you simply follow what’s trendy in your business and change your focus every month based on competitors' actions. You know you have a good strategy when you see that your activity system looks different from your competitors’; it should be unique. Additionally, when you have customers who love and adore you, coupled with non-customers wondering why anyone would choose your offerings, you’re on the right path. Not to mention, if competitors are making good profits, they are less likely to attack you because you’ve made sound strategic choices, which in turn leaves some niches open for others to play. Finally, having the freedom to outspend your competitors on resources indicates a well-functioning value equation. When your competitors focus on attacking one another while you remain the "laughing third party," you know you’re in a good position. And when customers turn to you for innovations and the next big things, that signals an exceptional strategy. That is my book-on-a-page summary and the strategic worksheet for "Playing to Win."

[something that is really close to your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=264) [heart and you should start that](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=266) [aspiration not from a

when you're playing you should](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=277) [have aspirations to win not just to play](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=280) [here I would just mention in

if](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=344) [you're a big organization and finally](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=346) [don't stop here aspirations are not yet](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=349) [strategy they're just the first step in](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=353) [defining your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=355) [strategy once you have your as Iration](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=357) [clear then you can think about where you](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=360) [want to play and where is in a very](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=362) [broad sense so this where can be in](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=366) [terms of geography it can be in terms of](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=368) [supply chain it can be in terms of](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=371) [customer segment or distribution Channel](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=374) [or customer needs price theer whatever](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=377) [there are lots of ways to Define where](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=381) [you want to play but you need to be](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=384) [clear on where you want to play and you](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=387) [need to seek niches where you are able](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=389) [to win this means that you actually want](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=394) [to look for the path of least resistance](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=397) [so you want to compete smartly you don't](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=401) [want to open multiple fronts you don't](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=404) [want to attack the strong established](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=407) [player headon and you should always be](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=410) [cautious when you find a niche that](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=414) [seems to be empty probably there is](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=416) [someone you just didn't notice who that](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=419) [is because you were not familiar with](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=422) [the niche and finally choosing to play](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=424) [everywhere is not a choice then you](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=428) [didn't make a choice you need to think](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=431) [through where you want to play

about these choices later on](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=449) [in the reverse engineering as we talk](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=452) [about that in couple of minutes if](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=455) [you're not able to create winning](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=458) [choices then you should get out of that](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=460) [game and look for another game also as](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=463) [you think about how to win you need to](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=467) [align it with where to play so for](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=470) [example if you're deciding to play in](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=473) [the premium segment of your customer](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=476) [base then probably the how to play doing](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=480) [sales lowcost sales and promotions is](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=484) [not the right how to play you probably](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=488) [need to bring build up brand Prestige](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=490) [and do things like that so when you know](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=494) [where you want to play you Need to align](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=498) [that with how you want to play as you](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=500) [think about how to play be mindful that](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=503) [the Dynamics of the game may change your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=506) [competitors are also playing you always](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=509) [need to keep your eyes open to see how](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=512) [the competitive landscape is](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=515) [changing if you're not winning then go](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=518) [back and think about the rules and](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=522) [modify the rules in a way that you are](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=524) [going to be able to win and when you](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=527) [think about how to win choices then](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=530) [think also in these choices for your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=533) [non-customer facing business you units](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=536) [as well your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=539) [functions once you know your aspirations](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=541) [you know where you want to play and how](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=544) [you want to play then you need to start](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=546) [to think about your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=549) [capabilities you need to Define your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=551) [essential](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=555) [capabilities at that are the same across](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=556) [your organization and that build on one](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=559) [another don't overthink this so it is](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=562) [not so important what's critical and](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=566) [what's not if something seems critical](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=568) [you should do that the important point](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=571) [in the book is about creating a unique](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=574) [set of capabilities your aspirations](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=579) [your where to play and how to play](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=581) [choices can be easily mimicked by your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=583) [competitors but your core capabilities](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=587) [are extremely hard to replicate that is](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=591) [your long-term competitive Advantage so](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=594) [make sure that you build a unique system](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=597) [as you build your unique system reverse](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=601) [engineer the activity system of your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=604) [competitors and make sure that you have](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=606) [a better system and as you look at your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=609) [own](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=612) [capabilities do a realistic assessment](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=614) [and do tests for feasibility so you're](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=617) [not surprised by living in la la land](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=621) [when you go out to the real world to](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=624) [execute your capabilities](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=627) [and finally you need to create](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=630) [Management Systems to keep you on track](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=632) [in terms of your strategic Journey this](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=635) [means that you want to build a rhythm of](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=638) [talking about strategy and revisiting](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=641) [your choices you want very clear and](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=643) [simple communication to your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=647) [organization so people understand what](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=648) [the strategy is you want to create](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=651) [metrics so that you can measure that](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=654) [you're developing your course or](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=657) [capabilities and you want to also create](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=660) [metrics that will measure your strategic](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=663) [choices so in a nutshell these are the](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=667) [five elements of the Strategic Cascade](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=671) [next to these five elements in the](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=675) [Strategic Cascade the book contains two](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=678) [additional valuable resources one is the](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=681) [logic flow and the logic flow is simp](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=685) [this process of thinking through](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=689) [segmentation structure customer and](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=692) [channel capabilities and costs how your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=695) [competitors are likely to react and](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=699) [creating strategic choices based on this](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=703) [assessment the other tool that's in the](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=708) [book is called reverse engineering and](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=711) [reverse engineering is about framing ISS](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=715) [issues as](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=718) [choices Roger highlights that unless](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=720) [you're able to create a choice out of an](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=723) [issue it is really not going to be clear](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=727) [to people what the issue is so you need](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=730) [to try to frame your issues as choices](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=733) [then you need to generate strategic](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=737) [possibilities for those choices this is](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=740) [how you get to this core question of](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=744) [what would have to be true and we're](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=746) [going to come back to this in just one](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=748) [second once you've answered what would](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=750) [have to be true for each of these](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=753) [strategic possibilities then you need to](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=755) [identify the barriers to each of these](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=759) [and Define tests how you can test these](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=762) [barriers and then start these tests](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=766) [execute these tests in a way that you](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=769) [test the weakest barrier first because](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=772) [then you can quickly filter out the](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=776) [options that are really not feasible](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=779) [because they failed on the first test](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=781) [now in terms of this question what would](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=785) [have to be](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=787) [true this was a revelation to Roger and](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=789) [he talks about this quite extensively in](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=793) [the book the point is instead of arguing](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=796) [on what is true and what not is true](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=799) [it's much better to have an argument](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=802) [about what would have to be true so you](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=805) [take a strategic possibility and you](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=807) [play the logic flow backwards so you](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=810) [think about what will or how will your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=814) [competitors react what are they're going](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=818) [to do and then you think about what you](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=821) [need to have what needs to be true about](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=824) [your capabilities your costs your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=828) [channels customers etc for this](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=830) [strategic option to be viable and you](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=833) [work yourself backwards based on this](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=837) [logic to validate different strategic](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=840) [possibilities so with that now let's](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=844) [spend just a few minutes talking about](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=847) [how I think you should be filling out](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=850) [this](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=852) [form it's really very simple so you](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=853) [should fill in the table following the](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=856) [sequence of numbers so you first fill in](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=858) [winning aspirations then where to play](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=861) [and so on we're going to look at this in](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=864) [one second and as you fill this out you](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=866) [should use the logic flow and the](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=869) [reverse engineering tools to guide your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=871) [thinking so how does this work you start](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=874) [with defining your winning aspirations](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=878) [under Point number one once you've](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=880) [defined that you move on to think about](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=883) [where to play you think about customer](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=886) [segment geography products Etc and then](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=889) [you've made up your mind about your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=892) [veyor to play you go back and you look](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=895) [at at your winning aspirations again and](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=898) [you write down any additional thoughts](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=901) [or modifications that came up regarding](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=903) [your winning aspirations and when you're](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=906) [done with that then you move on to how](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=909) [to win and you fill out your ideas about](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=912) [how you want to win your choices that](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=916) [will trigger a revisit of where to play](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=919) [and your aspirations and so on this is](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=922) [how you go through this worksheet all](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=925) [the time](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=928) [reiring back to previous points and](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=929) [refining your aspirations your where to](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=932) [play how to play Etc](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=935) [choices there are six traps that you](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=938) [should try to avoid avoid the do it all](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=941)

on multiple fronts don't try to](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=959) [meet everyone's](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=963) [requirement you cannot play in all the](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=965) [geographies all the customer segments](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=967) [everywhere at once at the end will be](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=970) [you're unhappy and your customers are](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=972) [unhappy don't develop aspirations that](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=975) [you're not able to translate into](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=978) [strategic choices and finally avoid the](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=981) [program of the month approach where you](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=985) [simply follow what's trendy in your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=988) [business and each month you target](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=992) [something else based on what your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=994) [competitors are](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=996) [doing and finally you have a good](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=998) [strategy you know you have a good](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=1002) [strategy when you see that your activity](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=1004) [system looks different from your](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=1007) [competitors it's Unique when you have](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=1009) [customers who love you who adore you but](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=1012) [you also have non-customers who just](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=1015) [simply don't understand why would anyone](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=1017) [buy from you there you have competitors](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=1020) [who actually make a good profit because](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=1023) [a they're less likely to attack you B it](https://youtu.be/HYjUZP-54mE?t=1027) [seems that you made some good
