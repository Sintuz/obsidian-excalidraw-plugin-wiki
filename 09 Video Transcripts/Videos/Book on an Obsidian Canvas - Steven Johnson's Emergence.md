![Book on an Obsidian Canvas - Steven Johnson's Emergence](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI)

# Summary
In this video, the presenter explores the book "Emergence" by Steven Johnson, focusing on how collective intelligence and self-organization function in various systems, such as ant colonies and human societies. The video compares different methods of summarizing the book using Obsidian's new Canvas feature and Excalidraw, inviting viewers to engage in a dialogue about their experiences. Ultimately, the presenter shares insights on implementing emergent principles in personal knowledge management systems and reflections from the visual thinking workshop.

# Key Takeaways
- The book "Emergence" discusses how intelligence and learning arise from self-organizing systems that operate without centralized control.
- Five principles enable macro intelligence and adaptability, including the necessity of critical mass for interactions and the importance of individual patterns in recognizing collective behavior.
- Personal knowledge management can benefit from emergent principles, encouraging bottom-up approaches that leverage simplicity and complexity in understanding human behavior and systemic organization.

Hey everyone, there's lots of excitement surrounding Obsidian's new core feature, the canvas, and I thought it would be super exciting to present the same book on the page summary using Excalidraw and my slideshow plugin, and then using the canvas so you can compare how the two are similar and different. I would be very interested in your comments to compare which one you liked better and how the two were different for you—which one works how you would use it so that we together can learn the best way to integrate the canvas into our visual thinking processes.

So why was I reading "Emergence?" Well, "Emergence" is a very good and interesting book, but also this is the book that we selected as a group in cohort one of the visual thinking workshop. Just as a reminder, the visual thinking workshop is a six-step workshop that takes you from the point of reading a book through creating highlights, processing your highlights, creating a book on a page summary, storing your visual permanent notes, and then doing a final showcase. This is my final showcase; the theme is going to come with their book on a page summaries this Saturday, so I'm very keen and excited to see what the others in the group have created. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=25)

In this video, similar to the other video I published two days ago, I'm going to share some of my reflections about the topic itself as well as some of my reflections on the visual thinking workshop, so you can compare how the two presentations work. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=45)

So this is the core part of my presentation: the discussion about the book. Let's start with the core message. At the heart of it, the book is about intelligence, personality, and learning that emerges from the bottom up. The example used extensively in the book is the example of ant colonies, but there are other examples used as well, such as slime mold, our brains, cities, software, etc. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=70)

As I was reading the book, I came to realize that I myself am a strong believer in the myth of the ant queen—not in the sense that I understand that the ant queen is not an authority figure. I understand that ant colonies are self-organizing organisms, and I know how it works; however, whenever I see collective intelligent behavior emerge, my initial instinct is that there’s some sort of centralized authority at play. My biggest learning from the book is that this is not how the world works. Most of the things that we experience in the world, including ourselves, our brains, cities, neighborhoods, communities, and the internet, are self-organizing systems, and there are some very simple principles at play. It’s a super exciting topic! [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=90)

Before we dive into the discussion about these three examples, I want to cover a couple of basic principles and definitions with you so you have a better understanding of the entire topic. So let's start with complexity theory; this is something that was coined as a term by Warren Weaver in 1948. He talks about three different types of systems: first, simple systems that involve a few variables and some simple rules, like planets revolving around the sun. Then you have organized complexity, which refers to situations when you have millions or even billions of individual elements, and the only way you can describe these is through statistical means. So for example, this could be how water is vaporizing or the statistics of road traffic accidents—these phenomena can be described with statistical analysis. Finally, and this is what the book is about, there is organized complexity, and here we are talking about examples such as a seed growing into a plant or an embryo growing into a person. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=115)

Now, Stephen also mentions emergent complexity without adaptation, giving the example of snowflakes and the intricate crystals formed by snowflakes, which are beautiful but do not serve a function. So this is a different type of complexity; we are talking about organized complexity that is able to adapt. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=140)

There are five principles discussed in the book that enable macro intelligence and adaptability to emerge. First of all, "more is different": you need a critical mass of agents to interact with each other for intelligent behavior to emerge. Second, "ignorance is useful": this means that you need to focus on the micromotives and the micro engagements and let the sophisticated behavior trickle up; this is a bottom-up organization. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=156)

Third, the high number of random encounters is key for self-organization to be able to find new optimals. So the more random encounters, the better the individual agents can sense the macro state of the system itself, and the higher the chance that from one local maximum, the system finds another local maximum. You can think of these local maximums in terms of maybe phase transitions, such as when water vaporizes or freezes, but I’m thinking of phase transitions related to major transitions in our civilization, like the Industrial Revolution or the information age. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=183)

The fourth principle is that agents must look for patterns in the signs. The example given in the book is about ants smelling the pheromones of 54 foragers in the space of an hour, imparting information about the global state of the colony. This means that an ant will know more about the colony if it remembers the previous hour of experiences instead of just looking at experiences one by one; this is the ability to recognize patterns. Finally, all you need to do is pay attention to your enablers, and this local information can lead to global wisdom through the interactions and processes mentioned earlier. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=230)

Next, there are two other topics I still want to cover in terms of basic definitions. One is about feedback loops; the example discussed involves the scandal around Bill Clinton's affair with Jennifer Flowers. As the story goes, the day before Bill Clinton's interview with ABC, Jennifer Flowers went public with the affair, and during the interview, when asked about the affair, Clinton denied it. The national news agencies like CNN, ABC, and NBC decided that this part of the interview was not newsworthy, so it wasn't aired. However, because local news agencies had access to CNN's recordings through an agreement signed back in the '80s, they decided it was newsworthy. The next day, all local news agencies came public with this part of the interview, compelling national agencies to air it too, creating a runaway positive feedback cycle that ended up in a scandal. The point here is that for self-organizing systems to work, you need both positive and, even more so, negative feedback. Negative feedback is the feedback that dampens the effect of runaway positive feedback. When the two are in balance, that’s called homeostasis, which is when a system is in balance. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=280)

Another important example, which is not specifically mentioned in the book but helps to understand the concept, is that complex behavior emerges from simple rules. The example here is a swarm of birds flying; if you want to simulate this mathematically, you only need three simple rules for the birds to follow: first, don't hit your friends—each bird should fly in a way that it doesn't collide with others. Second, follow the others—fly in the same general direction as your neighbors. And third, don't be left behind—go for cohesion because the one that’s left behind may get picked off by predators. If you use these three simple rules and present the simulation with surprises, it will react naturally, and you’ll effectively have a proper swarm of birds flying as a result. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=335)

These are the basic principles and definitions that are important for us to understand this whole topic. There are some other examples discussed in the book, one of which I like very much and want to highlight, involving slime mold. Slime mold is a single-celled organism that can act as single-celled units but also as a swarm when necessary. Interestingly, researchers long searched for a pacemaker among slime molds, but there is none; these are just individual interactions between the single-celled creatures that can create surprisingly complex outcomes. For instance, in one experiment, researchers created a network of old flakes that resembled the city of Tokyo and its outer suburban centers. Within hours, the mold had expanded from the Tokyo center and refined its nutrient channeling paths between the food sources, resulting in paths that resembled the Tokyo train network. This is a compelling visual example of how an unintelligent single-celled organism can display intelligent behavior and solve a complex routing problem. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=397)

Now let's discuss these three topics: first, our brains; then, cities; and finally, software systems. When talking about our brains, there are two things I want to highlight. First, our brain consists of neurons that are connected to one another, and these connections create a positive feedback loop. Signals run around in the brain in a positive feedback cycle, but the absolute refractory period—fatigue of the neurons—creates a negative feedback cycle because, during that period, neurons cannot pick up new signals. This helps maintain the homeostasis of our thinking. Ultimately, our thinking and personality is a result of millions and millions of neurons interacting with each other in a self-organizing manner. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=523)

An interesting theory that Stephen shares in the book is about us only being conscious of our own thoughts because we evolved the ability to simulate the thoughts of others. This is all about humans being social creatures; to act in a social environment, we need to simulate the thoughts of others to predict how they will react and adjust our actions accordingly. As the theory explains, as we developed this capability, it also created our self-awareness; it began with the ability to simulate others. In an experiment mentioned in the book, researchers had a group of children observe as an experimenter emptied a box of Smarties and replaced them with pencils. After placing the box on the table, an unsuspecting adult entered the room and was asked what they thought was inside. The interesting finding was that four-year-olds could accurately separate their understanding of what had just happened; they knew that the box now contained pencils but would predict that the adult would still expect Smarties inside. In contrast, three-year-olds could not predict this accurately and would say the adult would expect pencils. This developmental leap occurs between ages three and four, suggesting an evolved ability to simulate thoughts of others, which limits our social interaction capacity to around 50 individuals. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=625)

The next group of examples from Stephen's book discusses cities, with the notion that the sidewalk is the gap junction of city life. While writing the book, Stephen also read "The Death and Life of Great American Cities" by Jane Jacobs. Jane argues that it’s on the sidewalks, where people meet, that interactions happen leading to the formation of neighborhoods and communities. Jane emphasizes the importance of sidewalks and short blocks; for example, if you run a business, you want a location near similar businesses to attract customers, while also being far enough from competitors. This dynamic helps form stable neighborhoods where butchers, artists, and lawyers end up in different parts of town, which remain stable over centuries even though other factors change. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=740)

An interesting historical example mentioned is Manchester City in the early 1800s, which rapidly doubled in size during a short period. During this time, neighborhoods automatically formed, and these remain the same neighborhoods today. It was clear that no central organization dictated this; rather, it evolved following self-organization processes. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=780)

The third category of examples involves internet and software systems. Stephen discusses the community site Slashdot, which grew quickly in the late '90s and faced a challenge with a minority of undesirable participants taking over discussions. This issue led to the creation of a karma system by the site's founder. Moderators were appointed for limited periods and had a set number of points to assign to articles. Articles could be rated from -1 to +5, and the points reflected the quality of the content. This karma system has since been adopted by various other sites. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=890)

Stephen also touches on the skepticism at the time regarding online auctions, as many believed they would never gain popularity due to risks associated with scams. However, similar feedback systems emerged, allowing good artists to thrive while automatically filtering out scammers. Additionally, several games like SimCity and Gearheads are mentioned in the book as useful to understand self-organizing systems. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=970)

In conclusion, the takeaway from the book, apart from my previously held belief in the myth of the ant queen, is that many complexities, such as city traffic, are best solved by solutions that trigger bottom-up approaches. However, when utilizing a bottom-up model, predicting outcomes can be challenging, as the nature of self-organizing systems makes it difficult to simulate and know what will happen until it's implemented. It takes a level of bravery to pursue self-organizing solutions since pressing play on those models can lead to unpredictable results. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1070)

Now, reflecting on my experiences reading the book, I started thinking about how I can use the principles of emergence in my corporate job. I am a strong believer in agile methodologies, and during the workshop, one of the participants recommended the book "Management 3.0." This book discusses strategies for managing complex projects that I found insightful. The insights I gained from reading the book, along with the contributions from workshop participants, significantly enhanced my overall understanding. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1120)

Another reflection focused on self-organizing teams, with Spotify's agile model highlighting one way to introduce self-organization into corporate environments. I also pondered the potential for making my personal knowledge management (PKM) system emergent, considering ways to implement bottom-up intelligence. While I’m unsure if this is fully feasible, I plan to explore the five principles enabling macro intelligence and how they can apply to my PKM system. I'll be reflecting on this further and may create a dedicated video to share my findings and progress in creating emergent behavior within my Obsidian setup. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1240)

For me, creating atomic notes and incorporating an ontology on every link and page represents steps towards fostering emergent processes in my knowledge management strategy. Additionally, I have other ideas regarding the impact of facilitating random encounters, which I am also excited to explore. Reflecting on the visual thinking workshop particularly, we utilized Discord as our virtual classroom, which I found to be an effective platform for engaging and facilitating discussions amongst participants. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1405)

The workshop felt similar to a book club due to the depth of discussions and insights provided. I also gathered various additional resources to explore, such as "Slidology" and "Understanding Comics," especially looking into transitions within comics and how to apply these techniques when analyzing or presenting book content through my own canvas or summaries. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1550)

Without going into further details, this wraps up my book on a page summary using the Obsidian canvas. Please watch the other version using Excalidraw, and let me know which one you prefer. If you're interested in the visual thinking workshop, I still have a couple of spots available for the January cohort. You can find the link in the video description to join the workshop! Thank you for watching this video until the end, and I hope to see you next time! [* ](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1690)

and](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=251) [the only way you can describe this is](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=254) [through statistical means so for example](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=257) [this is here how water is vaporizing or](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=259) [this is the example of the statistics of](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=263) [road traffic accidents these phenomena](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=267) [can be described with statistical](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=270) [analysis](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=272) [and finally and this is what the book is](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=274) [about the category is organized](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=277) [complexity and here we are talking about](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=280) [examples such as a seed growing into a](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=283) [plant or an embryo growing into a person](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=286) [now Stephen also mentions emergent](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=290) [complexity without adaptation and he](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=293) [mentions](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=297) [snowflakes and the intricate crystals](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=298) [formed by snowflakes as an example which](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=301) [are beautiful but according to Stephen](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=304) [they serve no function so it's a](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=306) [different type of complexity we are](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=309) [talking about the organized complexity](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=312) [that is able to adapt](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=314) [now there are five principles discussed](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=317) [in the book that will enable macro](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=319) [intelligence and adaptability to emerge](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=322) [first of all more is different there's](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=325) [you need a critical mass of agents to](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=328) [interact with each other for this](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=332) [intelligent Behavior to emerge](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=334) [second ignorance is useful this means](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=337) [that you need to focus on the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=340) [micromotives and the micro engagements](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=342) [and let the sophisticated Behavior](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=345) [trickle up so this is a bottom up](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=348) [organization](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=350) [second is that the high number of Random](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=352) [Encounters are key for the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=356) [self-organization to be able to find new](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=359) [optimums so the more Random Encounters](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=362) [the better the individual agents can](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=366) [sense the macro state of the system](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=370) [itself and the higher the chance that](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=372) [from one local maximum the system finds](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=375) [another local maximum and another local](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=379) [maximum you can think of these local](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=381) [maximums also in the terms of maybe](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=383) [phase transitions so phase transition is](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=387) [for example when water](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=391) [vaporizes or when water freezes](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=393) [but here I'm thinking of phase](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=396) [transitions like the Industrial](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=398) [Revolution or like the information age](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=401) [or any other major transitions in our](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=404) [civilization the fourth principle is](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=406) [that agents must look for patterns in](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=409) [the signs the example given in the book](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=411) [is an example concerning ants that](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=414) [smelling the pheromones of 50 foragers](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=417) [in the space of an hour imparts](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=420) [information about the global state of](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=423) [the colony meaning that the ant will](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=425) [know more about the colony if the ant](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=429) [remembers the previous one hour of](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=432) [experiences instead of just looking at](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=435) [experiences one by one this is the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=438) [ability to recognize patterns finally](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=441) [all you need to do is to pay attention](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=444) [to your enablers and this local](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=447) [information can lead to Global wisdom](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=449) [through the interactions and the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=453) [processes and mentioned earlier](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=455) [there are two other things that I still](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=457) [want to cover in terms of the basic](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=460) [definitions one is about feedback loops](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=462) [the example discussed in the book](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=465) [concerns the Scandal around Bill](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=468) [Clinton's affair with Jennifer Flowers](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=470) [as The Story Goes the day before Bill](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=472) [Clinton's interview with ABC Jennifer](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=476) [Flowers came public on the affair and](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=478) [the interviewer at the interview as Bill](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=482) [Clinton about the affair and Bill](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=485) [Clinton denied the affair the national](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=487) [news agencies like CNN ABC NBC decided](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=490) [that this was not newsworthy so the this](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=495) [part of the interview was not aired but](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=498) [because the local news agencies had](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=501) [access to CNN's recordings through an](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=504) [agreement signed back in the 80s](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=507) [local news agencies the next day decided](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=510) [that this was actually newsworthy so all](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=514) [of the local news agencies came public](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=517) [on this part of the interview and once](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=519) [this happened the national agencies had](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=523) [no other choice but also to air this](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=526) [interview and this created a runaway](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=529) [positive feedback cycle that ended up in](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=532) [a scandal the point here is that for](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=536) [self-organizing systems to work you need](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=540) [both positive but even more so negative](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=542) [feedback negative feedback is the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=545) [feedback that dampens the effect of](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=548) [runaway positive feedback when the two](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=551) [are in Balance the positive and the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=555) [negative are imbalanced that's called](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=557) [homelastasis and that is when a system](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=559) [is in Balance the other example that's](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=562) [important I think this is not](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=565) [specifically mentioned in the book but I](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=567) [think helps understand the concept is](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=570) [that complex Behavior emerges from](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=573) [simple rules the example here is a swarm](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=576) [of birds flying if you want to simulate](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=581) [this with a mathematical model then you](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=583) [only need three simple rules for the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=587) [birds to follow](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=589) [rule number one is don't hit your](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=590) [friends so each bird should fly in a way](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=593) [that it doesn't collide with the others](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=596) [the second rule is to follow the other](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=598) [so fly in the same general direction as](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=602) [your neighbors and third don't be left](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=606) [behind go for cohesion because the one](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=610) [that's left behind is going to be picked](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=614) [off by Predators if you use these three](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=616) [Simple Rules](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=619) [and you start the simulation and you](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=621) [present the simulation with surprises](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=623) [the simulation is going to react to it](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=625) [in a natural way and you're going to](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=628) [have a proper swarm of birds flying or](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=631) [simulated this way so these are the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=634) [basic principles and I think definitions](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=638) [that are important for us to understand](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=641) [this whole topic there are some other](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=644) [examples discussed in the book one that](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=646) [I like very much and want to highlight](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=649) [involves the slime mold and the slime](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=652) [mold is a single-celled organism that](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=655) [can act as single celled units but also](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=659) [as a swarm when it needs to](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=663) [and the interesting thing is researchers](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=666) [for a very long time were looking for](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=669) [the pacemaker among slime mold and there](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=672) [is no pacemaker these are just](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=676) [individual interactions between these](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=678) [single-celled creatures and they can](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=680) [create pretty](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=683) [surprising awesome things so for example](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=684) [in one experiment](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=687) [researchers created a network of old](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=689) [flakes that resembled the city of Tokyo](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=692) [and its outer lying Suburban centers and](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=695) [within hours the mold had expanded from](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=700) [Tokyo Center and then continued to](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=703) [refine its nutrient channeling cubes](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=706) [between the food sources with the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=708) [resulting paths resembling the Tokyo](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=711) [train Network](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=714) [and so this is a very](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=715) [I think visual example of how an](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=718) [unintelligent single cell organism can](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=723) [actually display a very intelligent](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=727) [Behavior solve a complex routing problem](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=730) [so now let's talk about these three](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=736) [topics so first of all let's talk about](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=739) [our brains then let's talk about cities](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=742) [and then let's talk about software](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=745) [systems and then finally we will move on](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=747) [to some reflections](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=750) [so when talking about our brain there](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=752) [are two things that I want to highlight](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=755) [so first of all our brain consists of](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=758) [neurons that are connected to one](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=762) [another and these connections create a](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=765) [positive feedback loop so you have the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=768) [signals running around in the brain in a](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=772) [positive feedback cycle but the absolute](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=776) [refactory period which is a fatigue of](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=780) [the neurons create a negative feedback](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=783) [cycle because in that period the neurons](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=786) [cannot pick up new signals so that helps](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=789) [keep the homeostasis of our thinking and](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=793) [in the end our thinking and our](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=796) [personality is the result of these](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=799) [millions and millions of neurons](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=803) [interacting with each other in a](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=805) [self-organizing form now the very end](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=808) [interesting example a research that](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=812) [Stephen shares in the book and that I](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=815) [thought to bring to you in this book on](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=818) [a page summary is this notion that or](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=820) [this theory that we are only conscious](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=823) [of our own thoughts because we evolved](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=826) [the ability to simulate the thoughts of](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=830) [others so this is all about humans being](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=833) [a social creature](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=836) [for us to be able to act in a social](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=838) [environment we need to be able to](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=841) [simulate the thoughts of others so we](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=844) [can predict how the other will react and](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=846) [so we can adjust our own action](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=850) [according to that](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=852) [as the theory goes as we developed this](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=853) [capability this also created our](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=857) [awareness of our own self our self-image](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=860) [but it was first this ability to](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=863) [simulate that was evolved according to](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=865) [the experiment discussed in the book](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=869) [researchers](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=871) [take couple of children and the children](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=872) [can see as researchers empty a box of](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=875) [Smarties and place pencils in the box](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=879) [and then place the box on the table and](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=882) [then an unsuspecting adult comes in the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=885) [room and the children are asked what the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=888) [adult will think is in the box now the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=891) [interesting thing is that four-year-olds](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=895) [are able to accurately separate their](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=898) [own understanding of what has just](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=901) [happened so they know that the box has](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=903) [pencils in it but they will correctly](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=906) [predict that the adult will expect to](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=909) [find Smarties in the Box while](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=912) [three-year-olds do exactly the opposite](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=915) [they are not able to predict what the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=918) [adult will think so this three-year-olds](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=921) [will say that the adult will look will](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=924) [expect to find pencils in the Box](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=926) [something between the age of three and](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=930) [four happens in our brain when we](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=932) [develop this ability to simulate the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=935) [thoughts of others this is important](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=938) [because our ability has evolved to](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=941) [simulate up to about 50 people so our](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=944) [ability to work together with people is](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=948) [limited to 50. now the next group being](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=951) [or next example that Stephen discusses](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=956) [is the example of cities and here the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=958) [statement is that the sidewalk is the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=964) [gap Junction of City Life when Stephen](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=966) [was writing the book](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=969) [he was also reading the death and life](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=971) [of Great American cities by Jane Jacobs](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=973) [and this is an argument by Jane Jacobs](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=976) [that it is on the sidewalk where people](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=980) [meet with each other where interactions](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=983) [happen that result in the formation of](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=985) [neighborhoods and in the communities](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=990) [that are formed according to Jane Jacobs](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=992) [sidewalks and short blocks are extremely](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=995) [important so for example if you're](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=999) [running a business you will look for an](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1001) [area in town where there are similar](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1003) [businesses around you you will do this](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1005) [because there are already going to be](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1008) [customers who are interested in your](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1010) [business on the other hand you will look](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1012) [for a location that is sufficiently far](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1014) [away from other businesses so that](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1017) [there's no competition and through this](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1019) [Dynamic of trying to go to the place](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1022) [where the customers are but at the same](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1025) [time trying to keep a distance](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1027) [neighborhoods are are formed and this is](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1030) [how it ends up that butchers and artists](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1033) [and lawyers are all in different parts](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1036) [of town and it's amazing how these](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1038) [neighborhoods are stable over hundreds](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1042) [and hundreds of years so even though the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1045) [streets the buildings the people](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1049) [Everything Changes neighborhoods stay](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1051) [stable and this is the dynamic this](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1054) [Dynamic that happens on the streets on](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1057) [the sidewalks the discussion is what](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1062) [drives this process the other example](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1065) [given in the book is the example of](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1068) [Manchester City in the early 1800s](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1070) [and here the story is that Manchester](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1074) [exploded in size it doubled in a very](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1077) [short period of time](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1081) [during this time](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1083) [automatically neighborhoods formed and](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1085) [those neighborhoods are the same](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1087) [neighborhoods even today at the time it](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1089) [was very clear that there was no Central](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1092) [Organization no one said that this is](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1095) [one area and that is the other area it](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1097) [automatically evolved following the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1100) [self-organization process that I just](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1103) [tried to explain using the example of](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1106) [businesses](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1109) [the third category of examples I want to](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1111) [talk about are the internet and software](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1115) [systems and here Stephen talks about](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1118) [couple of different things the first](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1120) [example that Stephen talks about in the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1123) [book is the community side slash dot](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1125) [this side grew extremely fast at the end](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1128) [of the 1990s and it faced a problem that](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1132) [a smaller minority of participants who](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1136) [were renting online who were cranks in](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1141) [the community](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1144) [overtook the discussions and it was very](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1145) [hard to find meaningful content on the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1148) [site because of all this noise this is](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1152) [when the karma system was invented by](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1155) [the founder of this site the way it](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1157) [worked is the role of moderator was](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1160) [assigned to a person for a limited](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1163) [period of time the moderator had a fixed](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1166) [number of points that he or she could](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1169) [assign to articles an article could be](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1172) [rated minus one two plus five the more](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1175) [points you get the better the response](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1178) [or the article was](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1180) [and this way the authors of the Articles](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1182) [who got the points could build up a](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1185) [Karma and this helped decide to filter](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1189) [out good and bad content and you could](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1192) [even adjust which level of content you](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1195) [wanted to see so you could only filter](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1198) [four and above or if you wanted to hear](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1200) [more of the noise then you could take](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1203) [that filter lower and you got a](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1206) [different feeling of the site this](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1209) [system has since been picked up by a](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1212) [number of other sites so I think the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1215) [rating system the karma system is today](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1217) [very familiar but remember this book is](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1220) [from 20 years ago so lots of things have](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1222) [since then evolved the other example](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1226) [mentioned in the book is this example](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1229) [that Skeptics](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1232) [at the time thought that Online Auctions](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1234) [would never become mainstream and that](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1237) [is because scam artists can sell bogus](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1240) [merchandise but because of the same](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1243) [feedback type of systems that were built](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1247) [these auctioning sites became](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1250) [self-organizing and in a way the good](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1253) [artists found their place and the scam](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1256) [artists were automatically filtered out](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1260) [then there's](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1264) [a number of different software mentioned](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1265) [or games mentioned in the book the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1268) [biggest discussion is around SimCity and](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1272) [how that's very useful in understanding](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1274) [self-organizing systems but also Stephen](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1276) [mentions the game Gearheads which was a](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1280) [very interesting game at the turn of the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1282) [Century as well as evolva so if you're](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1286) [interested in self-organizing games](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1289) [these are maybe topics to dig into](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1291) [so this is the part about the software](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1296) [so these were the three examples of](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1299) [self-organizing systems and then finally](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1301) [this so what](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1304) [so the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1306) [for me the takeaway from the book apart](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1307) [from me being a believer in the midst of](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1310) [the ant Queen and that is actually](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1313) [something I want to change that there](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1315) [are lots of problems for example City](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1318) [traffic their complexity is best solved](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1321) [by solutions that trickle bottom up](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1326) [however when you do a bottom up](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1329) [solution you can never really predict](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1333) [the outcome that is the whole issue with](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1336) [self-organizing systems that you cannot](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1340) [simulate you cannot really know what the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1343) [outcome is going to be so in a way it](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1346) [takes a bit of Bravery to go for](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1350) [solutions that are self-organizing](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1353) [solutions because until you press play](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1356) [until you do the simulation until you](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1359) [try the solution in real life you don't](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1363) [really know what's going to come out on](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1366) [the other end](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1369) [so this is my quick summary of the book](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1371) [itself and now looking at some of my](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1374) [notes and some of my Reflections so](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1377) [I had two groups of Reflections reading](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1380) [the book one was a reflection on how I](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1384) [can use emergence in my corporate job](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1388) [I'm a strong believer in agile](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1392) [methodologies and actually at the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1395) [workshop one of the participants](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1398) [recommended this book called management](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1400) [3.0 and in management 3.0 this is this](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1403) [pamphlet for complex project is](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1408) [something I copied from there I'm not](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1410) [going to read it here I just want to](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1412) [somehow show you some of the reflections](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1414) [that through the visual thinking](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1417) [Workshop participants and through this](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1418) [feeling of a book club I got so much](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1421) [more from the book](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1424) [so this was one reflection the other](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1426) [reflection on self-organizing teams is](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1428) [for example agile at Spotify of course](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1434) [this is not the only example but overall](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1437) [the way one way to bring](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1441) [self-organization into business into](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1444) [corporate life is through pushing the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1447) [organizational Community closer to Agile](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1451) [approaches the other question was in the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1455) [back of my mind as I was reading the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1458) [book and I started to create this](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1461) [permanent note about that is this](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1463) [question of is there a way to make my](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1466) [PKM emergent what do I need to do so](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1469) [that my personal Knowledge Management](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1472) [System automatically](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1474) [delivers bottom-up intelligence I'm not](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1478) [sure this is doable but I started this](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1482) [thinking here taking the five principles](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1485) [that enable macro intelligence so that](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1488) [and adaptability and to see how that can](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1490) [apply to my personal Knowledge](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1493) [Management System I will do a bit more](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1495) [thinking on this topic and then probably](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1498) [I will have a dedicated video on this I](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1500) [think this is super interesting and I've](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1503) [actually made some steps forward in just](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1506) [helping this emergent behavior in my own](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1510) [Obsidian World I will share that with](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1512) [you and I will be very interested in](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1515) [your thoughts but to give you a couple](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1517) [of ideas here so I think the high number](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1520) [of Agents comes from creating Atomic](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1522) [notes or adding ontology on every link](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1525) [every page will strengthen the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1530) [process of playing paying attention to](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1533) [my neighbor so for me creating an](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1537) [ontology for my links place to this](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1540) [fifth principle of self-organizing](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1543) [systems but then there are some other](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1548) [ideas here about high number of Random](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1549) [Encounters and how you can help that I](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1553) [have some thoughts on that as well and](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1555) [then reflecting on the visual thinking](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1559) [Workshop so first of all we were using](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1561) [Discord as our virtual classroom and I](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1565) [think this is also a topic worth a](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1569) [separate video I found Discord very](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1571) [helpful in this process with the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1574) [auditorium with the discussions with the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1576) [announcements with all its feature it](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1579) [was a very good platform for the visual](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1582) [thinking Workshop](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1585) [to facilitate the classroom the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1587) [engagements between the team and second](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1589) [I already mentioned that the visual](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1592) [thinking Workshop felt like a book club](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1593) [with an amazing theme and amazing input](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1596) [and I got so much insight about the book](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1599) [and I already mentioned management 3.0](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1602) [here's another part from management 3.0](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1606) [about](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1609) [complexity and how simple how something](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1610) [can be simple yet chaotic and how](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1614) [something can be also complicated but](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1617) [still ordered so this is an interesting](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1621) [discussion that links to complexity](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1624) [Theory here but then the other insights](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1626) [I received from the workshop were](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1630) [insights about the process so there are](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1633) [a couple of books on my to read list one](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1636) [of them is slidology the other is](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1639) [understanding comics and here](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1641) [specifically we talked about the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1644) [different](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1646) [transitions in comics and I started to](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1647) [look at this how to apply this to the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1652) [way I create book on the pages how to](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1655) [make the transitions how to use these](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1657) [different type of transitions](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1660) [so without boring you with all of those](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1662) [details](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1665) [this is where I would like to stop the](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1666) [summary so this is my book on a page](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1669) [summary using the obsidian canvas please](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1672) [watch the other version as well using](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1676) [xcolored draw and please let me know](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1678) [which one you like better and if you're](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1681) [interested in the visual thinking](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1683) [Workshop I still have couple of places](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1685) [left for the January cohort so you will](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1687) [find the link in the video description](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1690) [where you can join the workshop and](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1692) [otherwise I thank you for watching this](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1696) [video Until the End and I hope to see](https://youtu.be/2ynZxmqBfqI?t=1699) [you next time in my next
