![Excalidraw-Obsidian 1.7.27 - Image editing power tools](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt discusses exciting new features in Excalidraw for Obsidian, including the ability to import SVG files as customizable drawings and to set image sizes to 100%. The SVG import feature allows users to manipulate colors and elements within the imported graphics, significantly enhancing drawing flexibility. Additionally, the 100% scaling option ensures that images retain their original size when added to drawings, improving consistency in visual presentations.

# Key Takeaways
- Excalidraw now allows for the importation of SVG files as customizable drawings.
- Users can modify imported SVGs directly within Excalidraw, including changing colors and elements.
- The new feature to set images to 100% scaling keeps images consistently sized even when edited.

This weekend I should have really been preparing for next week's kickoff session of the Visual Thinking Workshop cohort one, but I spent my time procrastinating. Lucky for you, that means new features in Excalidraw. I want to show you two cool new features that I call power tools. One is to import SVG files as Excalidraw drawings, and the other is to force the embed size of images to 100%. I'll tell you a bit later why that is important. And while we are at it, thinking of the Visual Thinking Workshop, there is still early bird pricing until 15th of November for cohort 2 starting in January. [* ](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=0)

But let's look at the importing of SVG files. So let's imagine I want to include a dancing figure in my drawing. I open the Noun Project, I search for ballroom dance, I find an icon that I like, and I click download on the Noun Project. I can download the SVG file even with a free subscription, and once I have the file downloaded, I head over to Obsidian, and I simply drag my new file into Obsidian. Now, of course, I could insert this file like this; if I hold down the Control key, then I have the SVG file here, but I cannot edit this file. Instead, I'm going to use the new feature. You find it under the Obsidian menu and also in the command palette, and the new feature is this one right here: import an SVG file as Excalidraw strokes. Note that this is all experimental; there are some features that don't work, but generally, I've been using this, and I'm super excited about the feature. So let's look at this. I click this and I search for my newly downloaded file and I click insert. Now what you can see here, okay, colors are slightly different, but I can start to play around with this. For example, let's make the lady red. Let's just find the... oh let's close this. Let's make the lady red like this, and let's make the gentleman, for example, dark blue like this. I think already you can see the power of this feature; how you can start to customize the drawing yourself. They can actually add back the kneecap of the lady if we want, etc. We can color their shoes to be black like this, and we can color this shoe here to be black as well. Let me find the other shoe like that. So, let's color the shoes black, and the gentleman will have black shoes as well, and so on. You get the idea. So, this feature I think is super cool; it allows you to customize the SVG drawing, and then of course first you can insert it wherever you like, or you can even take this apart and you can take the guy and just use the guy if that's all you need, etc. You have full flexibility with the drawing. [* ](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=49)

So, the other feature I want to show you is the insert with a hundred percent. This is a bit more intricate feature, and it will take a bit of time to explain how it works. So to get started, I need to get back to the story of how I create a book on the pages. I go through the literature note, and as I read the literature note, I start to create these individual pieces of drawings that will then be combined into a single big drawing. So let's say I have my first drawing here, the perk versus shallow work. I come over to my empty canvas and I insert an image, and this was deep work versus shallow work like this. And I insert it. So far, this looks good, but then let's take another one. Let's take, for example, let's take a big bigger image that's going to help us. So let's take this deep life is a life well lived. This is it, so I insert this as well, and then maybe I want to add some text with it. So this is some additional text, and here the text has a size small. Now this is where I want you to notice the issues that I'm facing. Maybe between these two images you don't quite see the difference, but here you can see the difference that this is here small text size, and here this as well is small text size, but on this drawing they don't look the same. [* ](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=229)

Now, you could of course start to resize this, so for the time being, I'm going to delete that one. You could start to resize this until the text size sort of looks the same, and yeah, I mean this is sort of a livable approach. But what happens if you come in here and you edit? Maybe I'm going to add this circle at the bottom; if I come back, that has now resized the text or the image again because when I insert an image it will keep its surface area, and if you add additional bits, the overall surface area of the image will stay the same. So let me just show you; if now I add this right here and come back, then you can see that the size changes. Now if I insert this image again, I'm going to leave this image right here, and I'm going to insert the image again, and this was deep versus shallow work, and here it says if I hold down the Alt key while inserting, so I'm going to press Alt + Enter, then it's going to insert it with a hundred percent scale. So for the time being, the two images look similar; the... actually, this was slightly bigger, I think, or well no, it's the same, but we've been resizing this image. So maybe let me delete it and let me insert it the old way, so deep versus shallow. So this is the regular insertion, and then I would try to resize it to match the size or whatever. But here comes the interesting thing; now if I edit the image, maybe I'm going to again add my circle here, and I'm going to add it here as well, and I come back, then you can see that this image is still at hundred percent. So this retains its sizing, and this image, of course, got smaller because the surface area stayed the same. [* ](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=297)

Now there's one tricky thing: I can now delete this, that if I change the size of this image visually, I can still do this, but the next time I open this drawing, so I'm going to come over to markdown and come back, it will be resized to 200. So when you insert an image with the force at 100 percent, then that image is always going to display at a hundred percent. Now let me just come here and again insert deep versus shallow work, and let's put this image here. The other bit I want to show you is that in the markdown view, let's remove these bubbles here because I don't need that; I can also change an image to this hundred percent view in the markdown view. So if I click open as markdown and I come down to my embedded files, you can already see that I have this size 100 percent after the name of my image. So if I add it here as well, and if I come back to view this as Excalidraw, then this image is now forced to 100 percent as well, and you can see that the text size now matches. So in summary, you will want this feature when you have a bigger image that you've decomposed into smaller pieces, like I do with my book on a page documents, where I have all these smaller pieces as individual drawings in my literature notes, and then I combine them to tell a story on a book on a page. In that case, forcing the size to 100 percent by pressingâ€”so let's just insert image and 'Val lived.' So here's a deep life is a life well lived. What you need to do is you need to Alt + Enter when you embed the image, and I managed to embed a different image; you need to deep life is a life valued Alt + Enter, and then this is embedded with hundred percent. If you want to double-check, you can come over here, and you can see that the image is embedded with a hundred percent. Similarly, I can embed images at a hundred percent by dragging the image from here, holding down the Control or Shift key on Mac, and then holding down the ALT key when I drop the image, and then this is now going to be inserted at a hundred percent again. So the key is to hold down the ALT key and that will make your image to be at 100 percent. In a nutshell, those were the two features I wanted to show you; you can now convert SVGs into Excalidraw drawings, and you can freeze the sizing of images to a hundred percent. Thank you.

you can see the power](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=156) [maybe we can make this a bit darker red](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=158) [like this and you can already see

[lift so let's look at this let's insert](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=300) [image](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=304) [deep live](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=306) [well lived this is it so I insert this](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=308) [as well and then maybe I want to add](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=313) [some text widths and so this is some the](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=316) [Channel](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=322) [this is some additional text and here](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=323) [the text has a size small and now

text](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=340) [size and here this as well is small text](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=343) [size but on this drawing they don't look](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=348) [the same now](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=353) [you could of course start to resize this](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=355) [so for the time being I'm going to](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=358) [delete that one you could start to](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=361) [resize this until the text size sort of](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=364) [looks the same and](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=367) [yeah I mean this is](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=370) [sort of a livable approach but what](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=372) [happens if you come in here and you edit](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=375) [and maybe I'm going to add this circle](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=379) [at the bottom if I come back that has](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=382) [now resized the text or the image again](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=386) [because when I insert an image it will](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=390) [keep its surface area and if you add](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=393) [additional bits the overall surface area](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=397) [of the image will stay the same so let](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=400) [me just show you if now I add this right](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=402) [here and come back the surface area of](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=406) [the drawing Remains the Same but the](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=409) [relative size of the objects on the](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=413) [image get smaller and smaller now let me](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=416) [delete this mess from my image let's](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=420) [come back](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=424) [and again you can see that the size](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=426) [changes now if I insert this image again](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=428) [I'm going to leave this image right here](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=434) [and I'm going to insert the image again](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=436) [and this was deep versus shallow work](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=439) [and here it says if I hold down the alt](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=443) [while inserting so I'm going to press](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=448) [Alt Enter then it's going to insert it](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=450) [with a hundred percent scale so for the](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=454) [time being the two images look similar](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=457) [the actually this was slightly bigger I](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=461) [think or well no it's it's actually the](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=465) [same but we've been resizing this image](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=468) [so maybe let me delete it and let me](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=470) [insert it the old way so deep](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=472) [versus shallow so this is the regular](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=476) [insertion and then I would](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=480) [try to resize it to match the size or](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=483) [whatever but here comes the interesting](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=486) [thing now if I edit the image maybe I'm](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=489) [going to again add my circle here and](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=492) [I'm going to add it here as well and I](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=497) [come back then you can see that this](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=500) [image is still at hundred percent so](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=503) [this retains its sizing](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=505) [and this image of course got smaller](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=508) [because the surface area stayed the same](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=512) [now there's one tricky thing so I can](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=515) [now delete this that if I change the](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=518) [size of this image visually I can still](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=523) [do this but the next time I open this](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=525) [drawing so I'm going to come over to](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=529) [markdown and come back it will be](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=531) [resized 200 so when you insert an image](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=534) [with the force hundred percent then that](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=538) [image is always going to display

[insert](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=552) [deep versus shallow work and let's put](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=553) [this image here the other bit I want to](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=557) [show you is that in the markdown view](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=560) [let's remove these bubbles here because](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=563) [I don't need that that I can also change](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=566) [an image to this hundred percent view in](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=570) [the markdown view so if I click open as](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=573) [markdown and I come down to my embedded](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=576) [files you can already see](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=580) [that I have this size 100 percent after](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=582) [my the name of my image so if I add it](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=588) [here as well](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=591) [and if I come back to view

that](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=600) [the text size now matches so in summary](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=604) [you will want this feature when you have](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=608) [a bigger image that you've decomposed](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=613) [into smaller pieces like I do with my](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=616) [book on a page documents where I have](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=620) [all these smaller pieces as individual](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=623) [drawings in my literature notes and then](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=626) [I combine them to tell a story on a book](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=629) [on a page in that case forcing the size](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=633) [to 100 percent by pressing so let's just](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=637) [insert image and](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=641) [Val lived so here's a deep life is a](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=645) [life well live what you need to do is](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=649) [you need to Alt](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=653) [enter when you embed the image and I](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=655) [managed to embed a different image](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=659) [you need to](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=661) [deep life is a life valued Alt Enter and](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=667) [then this is embedded with hundred](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=671) [percent if you want to double check you](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=673) [can come over here and you can see that](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=675) [the image is embedded with hundred](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=677) [percent similarly I can embed images at](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=680) [hundred percent](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=684) [by dragging the image from here](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=685) [holding down the control or shift on Mac](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=690) [and then holding down the ALT key when I](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=693) [drop the image and then this is now](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=697) [going to be inserted at hundred percent](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=699) [again so the key is to hold down the ALT](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=703) [key and that will make your image to be](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=706) [at 100 percent](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=710) [in a nutshell those were the two](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=713) [features I wanted to show you you can](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=715) [now convert svgs into X collateral](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=717) [drawings and you can freeze the sizing](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=720) [of images to a hundred percent](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=723) [thank you](https://youtu.be/vlC1-iBvIfo?t=726)
