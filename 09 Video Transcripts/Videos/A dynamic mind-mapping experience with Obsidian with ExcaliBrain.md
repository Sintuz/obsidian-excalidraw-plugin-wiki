![A dynamic mind-mapping experience with Obsidian with ExcaliBrain](https://youtu.be/_wldRlxTAxs)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt introduces ExcaliBrain, a new dynamic mind-mapping tool within Obsidian that enhances note-taking and knowledge management. He demonstrates how the app allows users to navigate and edit mind maps, fostering lateral thinking instead of linear thought patterns. Zsolt shares his excitement about the tool's developments and its potential to improve the way we organize and connect our ideas.

# Key Takeaways
- ExcaliBrain integrates with Obsidian to create a dynamic mind-mapping experience.
- The tool supports lateral thinking by visually connecting related ideas in a non-linear format.
- The current version is still in development, with more features expected to be added soon.

Hey everyone, Zsolt here. I wanted to show you what I'm working on because I'm super excited about it. This is ExcaliBrain on the left-hand side, and this is the note that's open in the center. You can see that the page is displayed on the right-hand side. The note has a couple of parents, some friends, and some children. If I click on a child node, then the page for that node opens, and that node navigates to the center now. The new functionality is this button; if I press this button, you can see that the node is now embedded. As I navigate, the node is in the center, so I can simply navigate and edit right here in ExcaliBrain. For example, if I click on this node and I start to edit this node, I can add a couple of links here, and this supports lateral thinking. [* ](https://youtu.be/_wldRlxTAxs?t=0)

This actually challenges the concept of linear thinking. What you can see as I'm typing is that the mind map around this node is developing, and you can see some connections as well. As I typed in "lateral thinking," it already created some connections with these nodes. I can also see that lateral thinking has seven parents, etc. So, this is what I'm working on at this time. This is not yet production-ready; it will take a couple more days, but I'm so excited. I wanted to share with you this new development. I hope you're going to like it. Thank you!
