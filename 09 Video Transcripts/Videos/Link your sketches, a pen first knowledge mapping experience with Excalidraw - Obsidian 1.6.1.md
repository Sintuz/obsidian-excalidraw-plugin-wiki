Hey everyone, I am super excited today! [* ](https://youtu.be/_GfWailVKpc?t=0) Color drawing in Obsidian is finally getting to the point where I can use my pen to draw my knowledge and create links between my drawings, and I don't have to touch the keyboard at all. [* ](https://youtu.be/_GfWailVKpc?t=6) So in this release, I'm introducing some important improvements. First of all, the free draw tool has improved significantly; the flow is just perfect now. [* ](https://youtu.be/_GfWailVKpc?t=24) Second, David from the Excalidraw team fixed the issue with Scribble, and now you can use Scribble to write text elements directly. [* ](https://youtu.be/_GfWailVKpc?t=34) Unfortunately, this doesn't work that well—or at least I'm not that good at using it—so I created this script called Scribble Support. [* ](https://youtu.be/_GfWailVKpc?t=46) This brings up an input prompt where I can edit and modify text elements, and for me, this approach works just perfectly. [* ](https://youtu.be/_GfWailVKpc?t=58)

In this version, or this release, I'm adding some powerful scripts to the script library. [* ](https://youtu.be/_GfWailVKpc?t=64) I'm actually adding three scripts: first of all, the Scribble Support that you've already seen, and then I'm adding two additional scripts to link files to your drawing. [* ](https://youtu.be/_GfWailVKpc?t=72) The way these work is the first one is going to add a link to an existing file. You select the object that you want to link, select the file, and then you can navigate back and forth. [* ](https://youtu.be/_GfWailVKpc?t=84) You can see in the top right corner that the link was created. [* ](https://youtu.be/_GfWailVKpc?t=96)

The other script will create a new document for you, and in this case, you can choose if that document should be a markdown file or an Excalidraw document. [* ](https://youtu.be/_GfWailVKpc?t=103) Of course, you can give a title to this document as well, and again, you will have the link in the top right corner to navigate back and forth between the document and the other. [* ](https://youtu.be/_GfWailVKpc?t=115)

To make this work, you need to install the newest version of Excalidraw for Obsidian, as well as a couple of scripts from the script library. [* ](https://youtu.be/_GfWailVKpc?t=129) In particular, I've added these three scripts, and you also need to install the customizable page header buttons plugin from the Obsidian plugins store because that will give you the ability to add those buttons at the top of the page. [* ](https://youtu.be/_GfWailVKpc?t=145) So I hope you like these changes. Enjoy drawing in Excalidraw! [* ](https://youtu.be/_GfWailVKpc?t=164)
