Hey, so today I'd like to demonstrate to you how you can use Excalidraw to do some mind mapping. So first of all, we're going to create a new drawing, and we are going to create it in the current active pane. I'm going to name this drawing "Mind Mapping with Excalidraw." To get started, we are going to make this full screen. Let's get started with this question. So, mind mapping with Excalidraw is going to be our title. I'm actually going to change this to the handwritten font and I'm going to make this black. Let’s put something around this, so this is going to be a curly line, and let's just do something fun here like this. This is going to be our central title. Maybe we can even make this slightly bigger. There we go. I'm going to give this a color, so maybe this is going to be an orange background or maybe I'm going to make this sky blue. And there you go. I'm going to send this to the back, select this, I'm going to Ctrl + G to group this, and I'm going to just enlarge this a bit. [* ](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=0)

So when we think about mind mapping in Excalidraw, there are a couple of questions that come to mind. One would be how, maybe the other would be why, and then I think there is also the question of when. You might come up with other questions as well, and so let's just circle these questions. I'm going to make these transparent, but let's make their lines a bit heavier like this. I'm going to just copy this circle to the other items as well, like this. Then I'm going to make these into groups and let's just connect these up. I'm just going to use this simple connector where I'm actually using an arrow. The reason for using an arrow is because if I connect with an arrow, then if I move the object around, the arrow will follow it. And so that's the basic reason for using the arrow in this case. There we go, oops! There it’s connected, and I'm going to just use the shortcut. If I press 5, that's my shortcut, I’m going to use the arrow to this item as well. There we go. And so now the three questions are connected. [* ](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=45)

Now, let's start to work on this and let’s think about why you would want to do mind mapping at all and also why you would want to do it in Excalidraw. One reason is that it boosts creativity, and we can even add an emoji to this. Let's say this is going to be a thinking face emoji that I want to use here. And then, why else would I want to use it? I think I want to use it because it's actually a flexible way to draw. So, it's flexible. Let me continue on this and I will get back once the drawing is ready. [* ](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=80)

So I think I'm done with an initial draft. Let’s just look at this mind map. The three questions that came to mind as I was thinking about this topic were how would I mind map, why would I mind map, and when would I use this skill? Overall, the process might be slightly slower, and that’s also true for sketch noting. Compared to writing a bullet point list, I think the process is slower; however, it engages your creativity, it's more fun, and it helps you focus much more. The whole activity of drawing, writing, and thinking together makes for a much more efficient process. So then moving on to the question of how you would use mind maps and how you would create them in Obsidian. [* ](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=328)

I think first of all, it is actually not a visual vocabulary but probably more of a visual grammar that we need to define. The idea is you want to be somewhat deliberate with the colors you're using, with the shapes you're using, the lines you’re using, and the font sizes. But I think overall, the message is, don’t overthink it. This is not an exact science; this is to get stuff documented. I have this example here. This is the issue-based information system, and this is a graphical representation of an argumentation. This is one specific grammar that you could use in terms of defining issues, positions, arguments, and decisions, as well as adding evidence. This is an example where you have a visual representation with a fairly strictly defined grammar. [* ](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=352)

Then the other aspect of how is there are some best practices. If I look at best practices, I think it's always a good idea to organize around questions. You can see that I've organized around these three questions: how, why, and when. I'm using arrows instead of lines, and that is because arrows can connect to objects. If I move this around, the object will stay connected, which just helps with organizing the material on screen or reorganizing. Learn to use hotkeys. For example, these numbers up here are super useful. If I want to draw a rectangle, I just press 2, and I can draw my rectangle. If I want an arrow, I press 5, and I can draw my arrow. These are extremely helpful, as well as I have some hotkeys like to group objects. So if I select multiple objects, I can right-click and select group selection, but I can also do Ctrl + G for this to work. In Obsidian, you actually need to go to hotkeys and redefine the map or graph function in Obsidian because it has a default Ctrl + G assigned. It's actually good to learn some color names so things like sky blue, gold, orange, or orange-red, or whatever. These are good color names to remember; they just help you. If you know some colors that you like, then it's much easier to select those colors by the name. [* ](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=480)

You saw that I use my stencil library of icons, and indeed during the process, I even added this icon from one of my drawings. From now on, this is going to be in my stencil library. I also use emojis, so you can see in a couple of places. That’s a very easy way of adding graphics to your picture; I just add a couple of emojis here and there. You can also use drag and drop; you can drag and drop items from the file explorer. If I wanted to add this here, I could simply drop it, and I have my link to that object. Similarly, I can drag and drop block references if I have this excellent plugin and drag and drop blocks installed. At the moment, this is only available on GitHub, not yet in the community plugin store, but this will be coming soon as I understand. So those are some of the best practices. [* ](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=570)

If I look at when I would use this, well, first of all, I would use it in a daily mind mapping setup. In that sense, you could either use a mind map to plan your day or you could organize a mind map around a self-reflective question. Indeed, you can even use a templater script. Maybe in the next video, I'm going to show you how to create a daily drawing template with a self-reflecting question in the center. This way, you can already get started with an image up front. You can also use this for problem solving, group brainstorming, and I'm sure you have lots of other ideas for how to use mind mapping. [* ](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=668)

Alright, so I hope you found this useful. This is how you can do mind mapping with Obsidian Excalidraw. Enjoy sketching, enjoy Excalidraw, and let me know if you have any questions or ideas. Thank you! [* ](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=736)

[maybe the other would be](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=99) [why](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=101) [and then i think there is also the](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=103) [question of when you might come up with](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=105) [other questions as well and so let's](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=108) [just](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=110) [circle these questions

i'm going to make](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=126) [these into groups](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=129) [and let's just connect these up and i'm](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=132) [just going to use](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=136) [this simple](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=137) [connector where i'm actually using an](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=139) [arrow and the reason for

[there we go](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=170) [and so now the three](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=172) [questions are connected and so let's](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=175) [start to work on this and let's start to](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=177) [work on so why would you want to do mind](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=180) [mapping at all and i think also](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=184) [why would you want to do it in excoli](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=188) [draw](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=190) [and so one reason is that it boosts](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=191) [creativity](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=194) [and we can even add an emoji to this](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=197) [let's say this is going to be

[draft so let's just look at this mind](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=356) [map the three questions that came to](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=358) [mind as i was thinking about this

skill](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=366) [overall the process might be slightly](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=369) [slower and that's also true for sketch](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=372) [noting so compared to writing a bullet](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=374) [point list i think the process is slower](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=376) [however it engages your creativity it's](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=380) [more fun](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=384) [it helps you focus much more so the](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=386) [whole activity of drawing and writing](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=388) [and thinking together makes for a much](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=392) [more efficient process](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=395) [and so then moving on to the question](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=398) [how would you](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=401) [use mind maps](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=402) [and how would you create them

define](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=418) [and and so basically the idea is](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=420) [you want to](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=424) [be somewhat deliberate](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=425) [with the colors you're using with the](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=427) [shapes you're using](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=430) [with the lines

adding](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=468) [evidence this](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=470) [is an example when you have a visual](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=472) [representation with a fairly

[the](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=516) [material on screen or reorganizing](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=517) [learn to use hotkeys so for example](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=520) [these

g](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=562) [assigned it's actually good to learn](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=565) [some color names so things like](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=568) [let's look at some background colors](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=570) [here like sky blue](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=573) [or you could say](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=575) [gold](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=577) [or](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=578) [orange or orange red](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=579) [or whatever so these are actually](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=582) [a good](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=586) [color names to remember it just helps](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=587) [you if you know some colors that you](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=590) [like then](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=592) [it is much easier to select those colors](https://youtu.be/pWcHBmJLvLc?t=594) [by the
