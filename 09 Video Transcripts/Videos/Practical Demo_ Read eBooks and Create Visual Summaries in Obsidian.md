![Practical Demo: Read eBooks and Create Visual Summaries in Obsidian](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt provides a practical demonstration of a reading workflow using Visual PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) and Obsidian, specifically tailored for creating visual summaries of books. He demonstrates how to integrate notes and highlights from the book "How to Take Smart Notes" by Bob Doto, along with techniques for linking ideas across different notes. This approach emphasizes the importance of visual thinking and interconnected notes in enhancing understanding and recall.

# Key Takeaways
- Use Obsidian to create visual summaries while reading books, which helps in understanding and retaining information better.
- Integrate highlights and notes directly from the book text into your note system to create a cohesive reading experience.
- Leverage visual tools like Excalidraw and ExcaliBrain to enhance the way you organize and reference your notes, making connections between different ideas and resources easier.

# Content
Hey everyone, it's Zsolt here. Welcome to Visual PKM. This video is going to be a very quick introduction to a neat reading workflow that I'm doing. I'm going to use Bob Doto's "How to Take Smart Notes" as an example, but I'm not going to dive into the book—I rather want to show you my process here that I think is a very neat way of reading books. So let's dive in! Let me show you, and let me know in the comments below if you like these types of videos. I have to be honest; I did zero preparation, so this is an in-the-moment video. I just thought that this would be an interesting topic. So, this is my visual summary for Bob Doto's book. What I did was, as I was reading the book, for each chapter I created a visual summary, and each of these summaries is then organized around the book. You can also see that in part three, Bob goes into the process of writing. Frankly, I lost interest overall; this is a good book on Zettelkasten, so I can definitely recommend the book, but it was too much writing-oriented and not visual enough for me, so that was a bit of a turn-off at the end. But overall, the book and the information it gave me about Zettelkasten was absolutely fantastic! I loved it. What I want to show you is my structure behind this book. [* ](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=0)

First of all, this is my idea integration board for the book, and each of these mind maps is, of course, a separate file with their links and various elements. You can see here my notes about the introduction, about terminology, a little bit around the overall slip-box method, and this filter here. You can see this process that actually reminded me of another process that I recorded. So this is from "How to Take Smart Notes," or this is my illustration from "How to Take Smart Notes." If I open the book on a page for "How to Take Smart Notes," then you can see that I have this illustration here, and by just placing that illustration into my mind map right here on the introduction chapter, I created a link between these two. But actually, this is not the most exciting part. I will go into a bit more detail why I have a separate visual summary about each chapter because there's a bit more to it than just the visual itself. But in this case, if I flip over the page to the markdown view, then, of course, you can see my book page here. The bit that's special about this book is Bob was so kind to give me the EPUB version of the book. So he approached me and he gifted me this ePub, and I'm grateful for your gift, Bob! It was a good book; thank you for sharing the ePub. This also makes it possible for me to show you my process here because what I did was import this ePub into Obsidian, and each of my chapter notes are actually, if I flip this introduction chapter for example over, then here this is the actual book text, and within the book, I have my highlights right here. So this way, my reading experience and my note-taking experience are completely intertwined. Because the link to, for example, "How to Take Smart Notes" and to this illustration of how the byproduct of one production line becomes the resource for another, this linkage happens at the chapter level. Or if we take another look here at another chapter, so for example, let's open the summary for chapter 4. If I look at chapter 4, then I am now going to do something—I'm going to split this to the right, so I have the same page open twice, and this one I'm going to flip over to the markdown view. So now I'm looking at the same chapter, and this is how I'm reading the book: I'm looking at the chapter here; I'm making my highlights here, and if I come across an interesting idea, I add it to the right side. But I also add links here so, for example, if I want to navigate to this idea to give context to your connections, I can click here, and it's going to take me on the left-hand side in my document to that location. So this way, my notes in the mind map are directly connected to my notes in the book. And this is, of course, the source book notes here. [* ](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=45)

How do I import the ePub? Obsidian has lots of awesome plugins. There's an ePub importer plugin as well. In this case, I created a separate ePub import vault for this. So this vault, the only purpose of this vault is to import ePubs. The vault is normally completely empty, but what I can do is take the EPUB file that, in this case, I got from Bob, I can place it right here. Let me just open the Community plugin so you can see this is the name of the plugin: ePub importer. I use it mostly out of the box. The only strange thing here, I don't really understand why the developer chose this approach, but I have to provide the name of the folder from where I'm importing the EPUBs in an absolute path. So this is not an Obsidian path, but this is the path on my hard drive. So Obsidian sits on my F drive, and this is then the ePub import folder. This was to me a bit strange, but once I set this up, the process is pretty simple. I place the EPUB I want to import into this folder, then I open the Obsidian command palette and I type in "import EPUB to vault." Right now I have a single book here, and I always have a single book here because after that, I clean this up. I click import, and the book is imported. So here you can see the book is nicely imported. Now this is almost perfect out of the box, but you will need to do a couple of things to make it work. So for example, here you can see that these links actually don't lead anywhere. So unfortunately, you need to clean up the links. You can do this with some clever search and replace; you don't need to manually do everything, but it does require a bit of post-production editing, as well as if you want to—it images here, then they will have a name, but you can see here "main note 01300"—not a very good name. I like to name all of my images, so as I'm reading the book—not here, but once I copy this over to my main vault, as I'll be reading it, I'm going to rename each of these items with the rename context menu action here to give these individual notes names. But after some initial organization and cleanup, typically, I delete some of the unnecessary chapters from here that I don't really want in my main vault. Once I'm ready with this folder, then I will just simply open this folder in System Explorer or Finder if you're on a Mac, and I'm just going to drag and drop this into my main vault. What happens then is I create this file or this folder structure. So let me just jump here. You can see that this is my folder for the book "Zettelkasten Assistant for Writing." I have the idea integration board for the book here, but then I also have my chapters right in here, and each of the chapters are then the actual imported full text. Now, the way the chapters work—if I close this for a second—the way the chapters work is, as I read each of the chapters, I add the previous and next links so it is easy to navigate these chapters. I can just simply click on previous and next, and with that, I'm navigating the chapters in Obsidian as I'm reading or as I'm processing it later on. Then the whole idea of why I'm doing it like this is I can show you how all of this looks in ExcaliBrain. If I open ExcaliBrain here, then you will see that this is the ExcaliBrain view of each of the documents. So, you can see that I can also navigate the chapters here. I can press the chapter, the previous, and next chapters, and this way, by having this overview per chapter, it’s not only that I can quickly glance at this overview and be reminded of what the chapter was about, but I can, of course, navigate the chapter. You can also see here that I have a reference to my literature notes on "How to Take Smart Notes," for example, or I can see here that this is actually an example of—you can see this image here that I took from Matt McKean's "Nine Things I've Learned from Running My Distributed Setup" in a multiplayer R was the name of the article where I found this diagram. Matt talks about the daily first note approach and the content first note-taking approach, and the whole discussion here that Bob describes reminded me of this. You can see here that actually what Bob talks about is an example of the daily note first versus content first approach. Also, you can see here that this is an inbox handling workflow. So I have a link here to inbox handling. The way this link looks like this is because this is a ghost note or this is a placeholder note; I don't yet have a file called inbox handling, but I already have three notes that reference this. So if I come here, then you can see that there are various topics in my vault that are about inbox handling. One of them is what we just saw here; the other one is the Getting Things Done workflow by David Allen, and the third one is the workflow that is in "How to Take Smart Notes" by Zettai. So this is the workflow that Zettai talks about. But now, if we come back to our book, then yeah, we can move on. This is the basic idea that this way when I look at a chapter, I get this visual summary that helps me understand how the ideas that I read in this chapter connect to ideas in my vault. And here you can see that I'm referencing books like "How the VY Tool Can Change the VY Work" or "The Creative Act." I'm also referencing some of my permanent notes, like my permanent note about reference notes or marginalia. And, of course, here at the bottom, I also have some references that help me—these are mostly images, but of course even an image can be a connection, so you can see that this image, for example of reading, I've used in so many different places. I have a separate video on this topic; it's called "The Idea Mixer." I'm going to provide a link in the description that talks about how I use these icons that I reuse in multiple places to find connections between unlikely connections or ideas that otherwise I wouldn't recognize are connected. So, to summarize all of this, the basic approach that I want to advocate here and that I find super helpful in my own workflow is, especially if you're able to get your hands on the EPUB of the book or somehow the full text book, then importing that book into your vault chapter by chapter, adding this limited additional metadata that connects chapters to chapters, creates a super interesting reading environment. You're actually reading in Obsidian itself; you don't need to use a tool like Readwise or any of the other tools; you're reading here, you're adding your highlights here, and as you're adding your highlights, you're immediately adding links to other notes in your vault. This way, you're creating a connected—you’re integrating the book into your note system. And then on top of all of this, creating these visual summaries, as I was quickly glancing through my summary here of Bob's book, it was an awesome way to remind myself of what the book is about in terms of taking and making notes, in terms of making and leveraging connections. He talks about these trains of thought, and I like this metaphor of trains of thought. What he's referring to by a train of thought is the connection of Zettelkasten notes. Let me see if I have... yeah. So, this is what I mean. So these chains of notes about the topic that then you can pick up and use as the basis for your writing. So if I come down here, you can see that's what he's talking about, that when you're looking for a topic to write about, then your Zettelkasten system will talk to you through the web of chains of notes, and then you can pick these notes up, and you can do your slicing to cut the frail beginning and end and to cut unnecessary pieces out of this. So that's what this train is trying to illustrate. And with that, you can create your draft of a document. By the way, I'm going to provide another link here, which is the Excalidraw writing machine that sort of builds on this idea that Bob is exploring, but gives it a visual spin, which I think is much more powerful than just doing this all in bullet points and in text. But in whichever way you're more comfortable, the basic idea is this in Zettelkasten. And yeah, this is all I wanted to share with you; I think this is a super fun way of reading books, and not only fun but extremely good in terms of internalizing what you're reading. If all of this was interesting to you, then I recommend you check out the Visual Thinking Workshop. I'm going to have a link in the description as well. In the Visual Thinking Workshop, in the self-paced course and in the cohort, these are the sort of ideas that I'm exploring, and I'm providing a much more detailed walkthrough of the workflow and the processes and the tools of how you can create similar visual summaries of books, podcasts, videos, whatever you're consuming. I hope you liked this video; I would really be interested in your feedback. Do you like these in-the-moment videos or would you rather like videos that are well-prepared? And also, I'd be interested in what you think about this workflow. Would it work for you? Would you find your own vault too distracting? Do you prefer to read on paper, or do you consider reading on your laptop or on an iPad? Anything, any ideas that were triggered by this approach? How would you make this workflow even better? I would be very interested in what you think. So thank you for watching until the end, and hope to see you next time! [* ](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1090)

the most exciting part I I will go](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=164) [into a bit more detail why I have a](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=169) [separate summary visual about each](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=172) [chapter because there's a bit more to it](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=176) [than just the visual](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=178) [itself but in this case if I flip over](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=180) [the page to the markdown view then of](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=184) [course you can see my book page here and](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=186) [the bit that's special about this book](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=190) [is wob was so kind to give me the EOP](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=193) [version of the book so this was he](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=198) [approached me and he gifted me this eup](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=201) [so I'm grateful for your gift Bob it was](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=204) [a good book Thank you for sharing the UB](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=207) [and this also makes it possible for me](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=211) [to show you my process here because what](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=214) [I did was I imported this UB into exol](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=217) [into](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=222) [obsidian and each of my chapter notes](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=223) [are actually if I flip this introduction](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=227) [chapter for example over then here this](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=229) [is the actual book text and within the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=233) [book I have my highlights right here](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=236) [so this way my my reading experience and](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=240) [my notetaking experience are completely](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=245) [intertwined because the link to for](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=249) [example zun is how to take smart notes](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=252) [and to this illustration of how the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=256) [byproduct of one production line becomes](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=259) [the resource for another this linkage](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=262) [happens at the chapter level or if we](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=265) [take another look here at another](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=269) [chapter so for example let's open the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=272) [summary for chapter 4 if I look at](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=276) [chapter 4 then I'm now going to do](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=279) [something I'm going to split this to the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=281) [right so I have the same page open twice](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=285) [and this one I'm going to flip over to](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=289) [the markdown view so now I'm looking at](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=291) [the same chapter and this is how I'm](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=294) [reading the book I'm looking at at the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=297) [chapter here I'm making my highlights](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=300) [here and if I come across an interesting](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=303) [idea I add it to the right side but I](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=306) [also add links here so for example if I](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=310) [want to navigate to this idea to give](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=313) [context to your connections I can click](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=317) [here and it is going to take me on the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=320) [left hand side in my document to that](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=322) [location so this way my notes](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=325) [in the mind map are directly connected](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=330) [to my notes in the book and this is of](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=334) [course the Source book notes here so how](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=337) [do I import the UB obsidian has lots of](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=342) [awesome plugins so I there's an Epub](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=347) [importer plugin as well in this case I](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=350) [created a separate UB import Vault for](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=354) [this so This vault](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=358) [the only purpose of this vault is to](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=360) [import UBS so the vault is normally](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=364) [completely empty but what I can do is I](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=368) [can take the epop file that in this case](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=371) [I CAU from Bob I can place it right here](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=375) [and let me just](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=379) [open here Community plugin so you can](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=380) [see this is the name of the plugin ePub](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=383) [importer I use it mostly out of the box](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=386) [the only strange thing](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=391) [here um I don't really understand why](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=394) [the developer chose this approach but I](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=397) [have to provide the name of the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=400) [folder from where I'm importing the EBS](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=404) [in an absolute path so this is not an OB](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=409) [obsidian path but this is the path on my](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=412) [hard drive so obsidian sits on my f](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=416) [drive and this is then the Epub import](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=420) [folder this was to me a bit strange but](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=424) [once I set this up the process is pretty](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=427) [simple I place the UB I want to import](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=430) [into this WT then I open the obsidian](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=433) [command pallet and I type in import EPUB](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=437) [to volt and right now I have a single](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=442) [book here and I always have a single](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=445) [book here because after that I clean](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=447) [this up I click import and the book was](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=449) [imported so here you can see the book is](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=453) [nicely imported now this is almost](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=457) [perfect out of the box but you will need](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=461) [to do couple of things to make it work](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=464) [so for example here you can see that](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=467) [these links actually don't lead anywhere](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=469) [so unfortunately you need to clean up](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=472) [the links you can do this with some uh](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=474) [clever search and replay place so you](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=477) [don't need to manually do everything but](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=480) [it does require a bit of post production](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=483) [editing as well as if you want to if you](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=488) [have images here then they will have a](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=492) [name but you might so you can see here](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=496) [main note](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=499) [01300 not a very good name I like to](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=502) [name all of my images so as I'm read](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=506) [reading the book not here but once I'll](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=509) [copy this over to my main vault as I'll](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=512) [be reading it I'm going to uh rename](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=515) [each of these items with the rename](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=518) [context menu action here to give these](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=521) [individual notes names but after some](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=525) [initial organization and cleanup so](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=529) [typically I delete some of the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=532) [unnecessary chapters from here that I](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=535) [don't don't really want in my main Vault](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=539) [once I'm ready with this folder then I](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=541) [will just simply open this folder in](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=545) [system Explorer or finder if you're on a](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=548) [Mac and I'm just going to drag and drop](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=552) [this into my main Vault and what happens](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=555) [then is I](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=559) [create this uh file or this folder](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=562) [structure so let me just jump here you](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=565) [can see that this is my folder for the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=568) [book zle cast and assistant for writing](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=571) [I have the idea integration board for](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=575) [the book here but then I also have my](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=578) [chapters right in here and each of the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=582) [chapters are then the actual imported](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=586) [full text now the way the chapters work](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=589) [if I close this for a second the way the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=593) [chapters work is as I read each of the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=597) [chapters I add the previous and next](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=601) [links so it is easy to navigate these](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=605) [chapters I can just simply click on](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=609) [previous and next and with that I'm](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=613) [navigating the chapters in obsidian as](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=615) [I'm reading or as I'm processing it](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=619) [later](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=622) [on and then the whole idea of why I'm](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=623) [doing it like this is I can show you how](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=627) [all of this looks in EXC brain so if I](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=631) [open EXC brain here then you will see](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=634) [that this is the EXC brain view of each](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=639) [of the documents so you can see that I](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=643) [can also navigate the chapters here I](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=645) [can press the chapter the previous and](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=648) [next chapters and this way by having](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=651) [this overview per chapter it's not only](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=654) [that I can quickly glance at this](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=658) [overview and be reminded of what the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=661) [chapter was about I can of course](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=665) [navigate the chapter but also you can](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=668) [see here that I have a reference here to](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=670) [my literature notes on how to take smart](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=673) [notes for example or I can see here that](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=676) [this is actually an example of you can](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=680) [see this image here that I took from](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=683) [Matt McAn](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=687) [nine things I've learned from running my](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=689) [distributed setup in a multiplayer R was](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=692) [the name of the article where I found](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=695) [this diagram and Matt talks about the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=698) [daily first note approach and the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=701) [content](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=705) [first note taking approach and the whole](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=706) [discussion here that Bob describes](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=711) [reminded me of this so you can see here](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=714) [that actually what Bob talks about about](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=717) [is an example of the daily note first](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=719) [versus content first approach also you](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=723) [can see here that this is an inbox](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=726) [handling workflow so I have a link here](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=729) [to inbox handling the way this link](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=732) [looks like this is because this](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=735) [is a ghost note or this is a placeholder](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=738) [note I don't yet have a file called](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=742) [index handling but I already have three](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=744) [notes that reference this so](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=747) [if I come here then you can see that](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=749) [there are various topics in My Vault](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=753) [that are about inbox handling one of](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=756) [them is what we just saw here the other](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=760) [one is the getting things done workflow](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=762) [by David Allen and the third one is the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=766) [workflow that is in how to take smart](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=771) [notes by zun Iron so this is the uh](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=775) [workflow that Zen talks about but now if](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=779) [we come back to our book then yeah we](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=782) [can we can move on this is the basic](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=786) [idea that this](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=789) [way when I look at a chapter I get this](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=791) [visual summary that helps me understand](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=795) [how](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=799) [the ideas that I read in this chapter](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=801) [connect to ideas in My Vault and here](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=804) [you can see that](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=807) [I'm referencing books like how the VY](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=809) [tool can change the VY work or the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=812) [creative act I'm also referencing some](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=816) [of my permanent notes like my permanent](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=819) [note about reference notes or](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=823) [marginalia and of course here at the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=827) [bottom I also have some](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=830) [references that help me these are mostly](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=832) [images but of course even](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=837) [a an image can be a connection so you](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=839) [can see that this image for example of](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=843) [reading I've used in so many different](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=846) [places and I have a separate video on](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=850) [this topic it's called the idea mixer](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=852) [I'm going to provide a link in the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=855) [description that talks about how I use](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=857) [these icons that I reuse in multiple](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=860) [places to find connections between](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=864) [unlikely connection or ideas that](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=867) [otherwise I wouldn't recognize are](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=870) [connected so to summarize all of this](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=873) [the basic approach that I want to](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=877) [advocate here and that I find super](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=881) [helpful in my own workflow is especially](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=884) [if you're able to get your hands on the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=889) [UB of the book or somehow the full text](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=892) [book then importing that book into to](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=896) [your Vault chapter by chapter adding](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=899) [this limited additional metadata that](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=902) [connects chapters to](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=906) [Chapters creates a super interesting](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=909) [reading environment there you're](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=914) [actually reading in obsidian itself you](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=916) [don't need to use a tool like readwise](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=920) [or any of the other tools you're reading](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=924) [here you're adding your highlights here](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=927) [and as you're adding your highlights](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=930) [you're immediately adding links to other](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=932) [notes in your Vault and this way you're](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=936) [creating a connected you're integrating](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=939) [the book into your note system and then](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=943) [on top of all of this creating these](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=946) [visual summaries as I was quickly](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=949) [glancing through my summary here of of](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=952) [uh Bob's book](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=957) [it was an awesome way to remind myself](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=959) [of what the book is about in terms of uh](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=963) [taking and making notes in terms of](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=966) [making and leveraging connections he](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=970) [talks about these trains of thought and](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=973) [I like](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=976) [this metaphor of trains of thought what](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=977) [he's referring to by a train of thought](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=981) [is the connection of zettle cast and](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=984) [notes let me see if I have have yeah so](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=987) [this is what I mean so these](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=990) [These Chains of notes about the topic](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=993) [that then you can pick up and use as the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=997) [basis for your writing so if I come down](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1001) [here you can see that's what he's uh](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1004) [talking about that when you're looking](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1006) [for a topic to write about then your zle](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1010) [casting system will talk to you through](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1014) [the V of chains of notes and then you](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1017) [can pick these notes up and you can do](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1020) [your](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1024) [slicing to yeah to to cut the frail](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1025) [beginning and end and to cut unnecessary](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1030) [pieces out of this so that's what this](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1035) [train is trying to illustrate and with](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1037) [that you can create your draft of a](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1040) [document by the way I'm going to provide](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1044) [another link here which is the excal](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1047) [draw writing machine that sort of Builds](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1049) [on this idea that Bob is exploring but](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1052) [gives it a visual spin which I think is](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1057) [much more powerful than just doing this](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1061) [all in bullet points and in text but in](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1063) [whichever way you're more comfortable](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1067) [the basic idea is is this in zle Casten](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1070) [and yeah this is all I wanted to share](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1074) [with you that I think this is a super](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1077) [fun way of reading books and not only](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1079) [fun but extremely good in terms of](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1082) [internalizing what you're](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1087) [reading and if all of this was](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1089) [interesting to you then I recommend you](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1093) [check out the visual thinking Workshop](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1095) [I'm going to have a link in the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1098) [description as well in the visual](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1100) [thinking Workshop in the self-based](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1102) [course and in the cohort these are the](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1105) [sort of IDE ideas that I'm exploring and](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1108) [I'm providing a much more detailed](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1110) [walkth through of the workflow and of](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1113) [the processes and of the tools of how](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1116) [you can create similar visual summaries](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1118) [of books podcasts videos whatever you're](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1122) [consuming I hope you like this video I](https://youtu.be/nAdbCQ3qiLE?t=1126) [would really be interested in
