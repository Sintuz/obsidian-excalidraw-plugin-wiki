Hey everyone. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=0)

As you know, I'm in the process of rethinking my personal knowledge management processes. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=1) 

And as I was looking at all the steps in the process, I realized that I have a gap right at the beginning. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=5) My quick capture workflow is really not as good as it should be. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=7) My workflow today is simply to open the Obsidian app on my phone and type in whatever I have in mind. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=20) But unfortunately, Obsidian is not very handy for this process; it opens up slowly and it's a bit clunky to type in a quick note. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=27) 

Also, when I'm driving or I just want to talk to my phone, I cannot really use Obsidian for that purpose. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=38) So I approached the Twitter community with this question, asking people what their quick capture workflows and applications were. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=46) I was amazed by all the responses I received. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=51) 

This is a very colorful and also very scattered list; each of the lines here that you can see is a reference to a different application that people are using for their quick capture. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=62) There are also some best practice notes in terms of doing the scan of the inbox on a daily basis or on a weekly basis, or not even to use quick capture because if a thought is important, you will remember it anyway. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=77) 

Looking through the list, the clear winner was the Drafts app. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=91) By the way, each of these up arrows is a separate mention of the same application. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=96) I didn't count the likes; I only counted tweets that had the reference to an application and I added an up arrow for each of them. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=102) 

So, the Drafts app is the clear winner. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=114) My personal situation is that I have an Android phone and an iPad, so I need a solution that works on both platforms. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=119) Looking through the list, there were some other candidates as well. One that was mentioned by many people and also has an Obsidian plugin is the Todoist app. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=132) 

But for me, somehow recording ideas, thoughts, inspirations as to-do items — I don't know, I'm not comfortable with the idea and therefore I decided against using Todoist. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=140) Also, the features to capture an image or capture a voice memo — I'm not sure if Todoist has these features, maybe it does. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=159) Frankly, I didn't look into the details of the Todoist app. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=164) 

In the end, from all of these apps, there were two options I shortlisted. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=168) One of the shortlisted solutions is simply to use an email inbox, and this was promoted by Elena R. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=179) This solution resonates very much with me; I think an email inbox is a universal, easy solution. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=186) You can send to the inbox from whatever app you want, and it's just there; it works, it's a long and tried-tested technology. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=194) 

I think an email inbox is actually a great quick capture tool. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=209) I even created an empty mailbox for myself and set up a separate mail application there. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=214) I can quickly capture items because I was thinking that email is going to be the solution for me. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=217) 

But then as I looked further, Google Keep caught my attention. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=229) In the end, I decided to use Google Keep as my quick capture workflow, and I want to show you some of the features of how I'm using Google Keep. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=232) Maybe you can benefit from this as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=245) 

So first of all, using Google Keep on my Android phone. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=247) When you install Google Keep, you will get a couple of widgets with Google Keep. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=250) I installed both of the widgets on my phone so I can demonstrate to you how it looks like. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=261) In reality, I only use the one at the bottom; the one at the top I think is a bit too verbose. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=267) 

But maybe you like to see all your notes in your inbox, and in that case, the bigger widget is the better one. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=270) You have a couple of buttons on the widget: you have a plus sign to create a quick text note, a checkbox to create a quick to-do list, a microphone to take a voice memo which is automatically transcribed by Google, and you have the paintbrush to write something. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=284) 

You can use your S Pen if you have a Samsung Note, or you can use your finger or you can use your stylus if you have a stylus for your phone. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=301) Finally, you can also take a picture. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=311) One cool feature is Google Keep can capture the text from the picture. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=315) 

I will show you that in a moment, and you can also see the Google Assistant widget on this screen. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=320) The reason I have it here is because I want to demonstrate how I can use Google Keep with Google Assistant. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=323) You need to do some setup first: you need to go to Google Assistant settings and you need to change your notes app like this. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=337) 

If you set up Google Assistant like this, then you can use Google Assistant while driving or using your Google Home devices. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=346) You can just simply tell Google to take a quick note, and it will write it down. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=349) So, for example, if you have Google Home in your bathroom, you can step out of the shower or shout out of the shower to take a quick note, and that note is captured. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=359) 

So let me first show you the Google Assistant option: "Note to self." [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=373) "Alright, what do you want it to say?" [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=376) "This is a test note to demonstrate how I can use Google Assistant to take notes." [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=380) "Saved your note." [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=385) And that's it; my note has been saved. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=388) 

You can see it appear right at the top of the notes list; the note that I just dictated appeared in my Google Keep inbox. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=394) But you can also use the dictation feature in Google Keep. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=399) The benefit of using the dictation feature is that it will not only be transcribed, but also the voice recorded will be stored as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=405) 

So here, I'm going to say, "This is a test note to demonstrate how I can use Google Keep to take notes." [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=418) And that's it; you can see that the text has been transcribed and also I have the voice recording here, so I can listen to my voice or whatever sound I recorded in Google Keep. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=434) 

Going on, I want to show you another option. So, if I press the plus sign, then I can simply use the keyboard to type in a message. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=448) This is maybe good in a noisy situation; it's a bit of a slow process. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=455) But also, what you can do is use the voice typing on your keyboard, which I will demonstrate in a moment, and then it's a fast process. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=460) 

Now, looking at the photo option: if you press the image icon, you can take a photo like this. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=474) "This is a tree in our garden." [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=481) I'm going to give this a title: "This is a tree in our garden." [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=484) And I'm going to add a quick note using voice typing. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=489) 

I can also voice type using the keyboard, and then finally you can also take a handwritten note. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=491) So, in this case, I'm just going to simply write with my fingers on the screen, and in a moment, when I show you how to process the inbox, I'll show you that Google is able to recognize my handwriting, even this handwriting, pretty well. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=502) 

So that is the Android solution. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=525) Now, looking at the iPad, mind you, I'm much less familiar with the iPad. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=528) I tried to set up Siri to use Google Keep as the default notes app; I wasn't successful. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=532) But I'm also not surprised; Apple is usually not very open in allowing other applications. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=540) 

So I was only able to use Siri to take notes in Apple Notes, which was a disappointment. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=548) But on the iPad, I otherwise never use Siri, so it's not a real bummer. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=556) But I thought if I could do it, I could show you how it works. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=558) 

The basic use case on the iPad is you install Google Keep, you tap on the icon for the app, and then first, I'm going to take a picture of a page in a book to show you how you can grab text very quickly. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=564) This is to demonstrate the text recognition in Google Keep. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=576) 

If I tap the microphone, I can add a voice memo just like on my phone. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=587) You can take voice notes in Google Keep on iOS as well, and this will be transcribed as well as the voice recording will be saved. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=593) 

If I tap on the pencil, I can use my Apple Pencil to do a quick sketch or just take some handwritten notes. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=604) Again, my handwriting is really awful, and you'll see how well Google Keep recognizes this handwriting as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=611) 

So that's about the features on the iOS app. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=620) Finally, let me show you how I process these notes into Obsidian. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=624) My process is simply to open Google Keep, and in Google Keep, I see all of the notes that I have recorded. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=635) 

If I click on a note, for example, I click on this note, I can either copy the image and paste it into Obsidian, or here I can click the dot and choose "Grab Image Text." [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=640) You can see this is a handwritten note captured by Google, and now I can copy-paste this into Obsidian. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=657) 

As I do that, I can then delete my note from Google Keep. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=664) 

[Music] [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=673)

Like this, and with that, this note has been processed. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=676) My workflow is going to be that I don't keep items here; anything I want to keep, I'm going to copy into Obsidian and delete things permanently from here. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=681) 

So, for example, if I want to take this picture into Obsidian, I copy the picture, head over to Obsidian, and now, for the sake of simplicity, I'm just going to paste the image in here, and with that, you can see I have my image captured in Obsidian. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=699) 

It took only a second to do this process. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=701) Let me just show you how I can grab text from this book. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=717) It's very simple; I can click here as well, grab image text, and after that you can see here's the text from that page in the book, and I can just copy-paste this and process this in Obsidian. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=734) 

As with all the notes, I can delete the note after I've processed it so it doesn't clutter my screen. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=737) Let me just show you the text recognition on this note as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=749) Grab image text, and so you can see here, a quick sketch — in this case, it's not exactly a quick sketch. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=756) 

So my handwriting was really awful. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=761) I think still Google did a pretty good job, and if I would write nicer, the recognition would be better. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=765) Also, quite interesting that the text I wrote with my finger was better recognized than the text I wrote with Apple Pencil. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=770) 

So, maybe I was more careful with the finger writing. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=782) 

So that's it. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=786) That is the way I decided to use Google Keep. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=791) I have installed it on my phone and on my iPad. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=794) I configured Google Assistant so it uses Google Keep as the note to self app, and now wherever I'm using Google Assistant, I can just simply ask Google Assistant to take a note to self. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=798) 

With that, I can record an item that appears in this inbox, and every week I can open this inbox and process the items here, placing them in their relevant location in Obsidian so nothing gets lost. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=805) 

I'm pretty happy with this workflow, and I think this is going to be an important new addition to my encounter process in the entire personal knowledge management process. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=831) 

I hope you found this helpful. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=843) If you don't have a good quick capture solution, I encourage you to give Google Keep a try. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=848) I tested it, and I'm extremely happy with it. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=855) And best of all, it's a free service! [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=860) It works on all my devices, and it has quite a number of good features. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=864) Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=866)

## YouTube Description

Since the release of this video, I learned that you can visually integrate Google Keep into Obsidian using the Custom Frames plugin. You can find a screenshot of the solution here: https://twitter.com/zsviczian/status/1539485302368129024?s=20&t=oG4Z88Mx_cxFcuHmwjmeNw

In this video, I demonstrate the various quick capture features of Google Keep.

I am currently in the process of reviewing and rethinking my PKM processes and will be sharing my findings in upcoming videos. To make these videos more helpful, I aim to demonstrate a different visual thinking tool in each video.

[simply to use an email inbox](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=179) [and this was promoted by elenarconic](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=182) [but also](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=186) [this solution resonates very much with](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=187) [me i think an email inbox is a universal](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=190) [easy solution you can send to the inbox](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=194) [from whatever app you want and it's just](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=197) [it's just there it works it's a long and](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=202) [tried tested technology i think an email](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=205) [inbox](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=208) [is actually a great](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=209) [quick capture tool i even created an](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=211) [empty mailbox for myself and set up a](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=214) [separate mail application there i can](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=217) [quickly capture items because i was](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=219) [thinking that](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=222) [email is going to be the solution for me](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=223) [but then as i look further](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=227) [google keep caught my attention](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=229) [and](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=231) [in the end i decided to use google keep](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=232) [as my quick capture workflow and i want](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=237) [to show you some of the features of how](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=240) [i'm using google keep maybe you can](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=242) [benefit from this as well so first of](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=245) [all using google keep on my android](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=247) [phone](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=250) [when you install google keep you will](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=252) [get couple of widgets with google keep i](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=254) [installed both of the widgets on my](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=259) [phone so i can demonstrate to you how it](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=261) [looks like in reality i only use the one](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=263) [at the bottom the one at the top i think](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=267) [is a bit too verbose but maybe you like](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=270) [to see all your notes in your inbox and](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=273) [in that case](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=276) [the bigger widget is the better one](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=277) [and you have couple of buttons](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=280) [on the widget you have a plus sign to](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=282) [create a quick text note you have the](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=284) [check box to create a quick to-do list](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=287) [you have the microphone to take a voice](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=289) [memo which is automatically transcribed](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=292) [by google](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=295) [you have the paint brush to write](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=296) [something you can use your s pen if you](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=298) [have](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=301) [a samsung note or you can use your](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=302) [finger or you can use your stylus if you](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=304) [have a stylus for your phone and finally](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=307) [you can also take a picture and one cool](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=311) [feature is google keep can capture the](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=315) [text from the picture i show you that in](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=317) [a moment](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=320) [and you can also see the google](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=321) [assistant widget](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=323) [on this screen](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=325) [and the reason i have it here is because](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=327) [i want to demonstrate how i can use](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=329) [google keep with google assistant you](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=332) [need to do some setup first you need to](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=335) [go to google assistant settings and you](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=337) [need to change your](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=340) [notes app like this](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=342) [so if you set up google assistant like](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=344) [this then you can use google assistant](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=346) [while driving or using your google home](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=349) [devices you can just simply](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=352) [tell google a quick note and it will](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=354) [write it down so for example if you have](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=357) [google home in your bathroom you can](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=359) [step out of the shower or shout out of](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=362) [the shower to take a quick note and that](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=364) [note is captured so let me first show](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=368) [you the google assistant option](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=370) [note to self](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=373) [all right what do you want it to say](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=376) [this is a test note to demonstrate how i](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=380) [can use google assistant to take notes](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=382) [saved your note and that's it my note](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=385) [has been saved](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=388) [and you can see it appear right at the](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=389) [top of the notes list the note that i](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=392) [just dictated appeared in my google keep](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=394) [inbox](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=398) [but you can also use the dictation](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=399) [feature in google keep the benefit of](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=402) [using the dictation feature](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=405) [is that it will not only be transcribed](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=408) [but also the voice the recorded voice](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=411) [will be stored as well](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=414) [so here](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=417) [i'm going to say this is a test note to](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=418) [demonstrate how i can use google keep to](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=421) [take notes](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=423) [and that's it you can see that](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=425) [the text has been transcribed and also i](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=428) [have the voice recording here so i can](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=431) [listen to my voice or whatever sound i](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=434) [recorded in google keep](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=438) [going on](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=442) [i want to show you another option so if](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=443) [i press the plus sign](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=446) [then i can simply use the keyboard to](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=448) [type in a message this is maybe good in](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=451) [a noisy situation it's a bit of a slow](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=455) [process](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=458) [but also](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=460) [what you can do is you can use the voice](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=461) [typing on your keyboard which i will](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=464) [demonstrate in a moment](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=466) [and then it's a fast process](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=469) [now looking at the photo option if you](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=471) [press the image icon you can take a](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=474) [photo](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=477) [like this this is a tree in our garden](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=478) [i'm going to give this a title this is a](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=481) [tree in our garden](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=484) [and i'm going to add a quick note using](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=487) [voice typing](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=489) [i can also voice type using the keyboard](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=491) [and then finally](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=496) [you can also take a hand written note so](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=498) [in this case i'm just going to simply](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=502) [write with my fingers on the screen](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=504) [and](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=507) [in a moment when i show you how to](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=508) [process the inbox i'll show you that](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=510) [actually](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=513) [google is able to recognize my](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=514) [handwriting even this handwriting pretty](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=516) [well](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=519) [so that is the android solution](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=522) [now looking at the ipad mind you i must](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=525) [much less](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=528) [familiar with ipad i tried to set up](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=529) [siri](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=532) [to use google keep as the default notes](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=533) [app](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=536) [i wasn't successful but i'm also not](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=537) [surprised apple is usually not very open](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=540) [in allowing](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=543) [other applications so i was only able to](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=545) [use siri to take notes in apple notes](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=548) [which was a disappointment but](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=550) [on the ipad i otherwise never use siri](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=553) [so it's not a real bummer but i thought](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=556) [if i could do it i could show you how it](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=558) [works so the basic use case on the ipad](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=561) [is you install google keep you tap on](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=564) [the icon for the app and then](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=567) [first i'm going to take a picture of a](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=571) [page in a book](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=574) [to show you how you can grab text very](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=576) [quickly this is to demonstrate the text](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=579) [recognition in google keep](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=582) [if i tap the microphone i can add a](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=584) [voice memo just like on my phone you can](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=587) [take voice note single will keep on ios](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=590) [as well](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=593) [and this will be transcribed as well as](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=595) [the voice recording will be saved if i](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=598) [tap on the pencil i can use my apple](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=602) [pencil](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=604) [to](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=605) [do a quick sketch or just take some](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=606) [handwritten notes and again my](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=608) [handwriting is really awful and you'll](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=611) [see how well google keep recognizes this](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=614) [handwriting as well](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=617) [so that's about the features on the ios](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=620) [app](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=623) [and then finally let me show you how i](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=624) [process these notes into obsidian](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=627) [my process is simply to open google keep](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=631) [and in google keep i see all of the](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=635) [notes that i have recorded](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=638) [and if i click on a note for example](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=640) [i click on this note](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=643) [i can](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=645) [either](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=646) [copy the image and paste the image into](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=647) [obsidian or here i can click the dot](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=650) [and choose grab image text and you can](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=653) [see this is a handwritten note captured](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=657) [by google and now i can copy paste this](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=660) [into obsidian and as i do that i can](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=664) [then](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=667) [delete my note from google keep](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=668) [[Music]](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=673) [like this and with that](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=674) [this note has been processed my workflow](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=676) [is going to be](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=679) [i](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=681) [don't keep items here](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=682) [anything i want to keep i'm going to](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=684) [copy into obsidian and i delete things](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=686) [permanently for here from here so for](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=690) [example if i want to take this picture](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=692) [into obsidian i copy the picture i](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=695) [head over to obsidian and now for the](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=699) [sake of simplicity i'm just going to](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=701) [paste](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=703) [the image in here and with that you can](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=704) [see i have my image captured in obsidian](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=707) [it took only a second to do this process](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=710) [let me just show you how i can grab text](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=717) [from this book](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=720) [and it's very simple i can click here as](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=722) [well grab image text](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=725) [and after that you can see here's the](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=728) [text from that page in the book and i](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=730) [can just copy paste this and process](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=734) [this](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=737) [in obsidian and as with all the notes i](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=737) [can delete the note after i've processed](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=741) [the note so it doesn't clutter my screen](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=744) [let me just show you the text](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=747) [recognition on this note as well](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=749) [grab image text and so you can see here](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=751) [a quick sketch in this case is not](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=756) [exactly a quick sketch so my handwriting](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=759) [was really awful i think still google](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=762) [did a pretty good job and if i would](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=765) [write nicer the recognition would be](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=767) [better also quite interesting that the](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=770) [text i wrote with my finger](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=773) [was better recognized than the text i](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=775) [wrote with apple pencil](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=777) [so](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=780) [maybe](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=781) [i was more careful](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=782) [with the finger writing](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=783) [so that's it](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=786) [that is the way i decided to use google](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=787) [keep i have installed it on my phone on](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=791) [my ipad i configured google assistant so](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=794) [it uses google keep as the note to self](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=798) [app and now wherever i'm using google](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=801) [assistant i can just simply ask google](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=805) [assistant](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=807) [to take a note to self and with that i](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=808) [can record an item that appears in this](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=811) [inbox](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=814) [and every week i can open this inbox and](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=815) [process the items here and place them to](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=819) [their relevant](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=822) [location](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=824) [in obsidian so nothing gets lost](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=825) [i'm pretty happy with this workflow](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=829) [and i think this is going to be an](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=831) [important new addition to my encounter](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=834) [process](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=837) [in the entire personal knowledge](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=838) [management process](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=840) [i hope you found this helpful](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=843) [if you don't have a good quick capture](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=845) [solution i encourage you to give google](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=848) [keep a try](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=851) [i tested it](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=854) [i'm extremely happy with it](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=855) [and best of all it's a free service](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=857) [it works on all my devices and it has](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=860) [quite a number of good features](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=864) [thank you](https://youtu.be/Eic-SmIMG2Y?t=866)
