Hey, this is part four. We're going to be talking about the stencil library, and in this part, I'm going to show you how to add items to the library as well as how to browse the library from Excalidraw. You find the stencil library by clicking this button, and you can see I already have a couple of items here. Say I don't find what I want, then I can click browse the library, and here I can go through the various library items already available with Excalidraw. Say I want to add these computers to my Excalidraw in Obsidian. Don't click "add to Excalidraw," this one does not work with Obsidian. Click "download," and when you click download, then this is going to be downloaded to your default download folder. You click "load in Excalidraw," and you can choose the newly downloaded library. You can see I've added the computer to my set of images here. If I want to use one of these, I just simply click on it, and I have the image right here. Say I want to enhance this image a little and let's add a couple of boxes to make this picture a bit more complete. I'm also going to add this circle here, and this is going to be the image I want to add. I'm going to first group my selection, and with the group selection, I'm going to select the item and click "add to library." With that, if I now come to the library, you can see that my new computer with these three boxes and circle was added, and I can just simply click and add it to my drawing. As well as if I don't like one of the items here and no longer need it, I can click here to remove the item from the library, and then you can keep only the images that you want to reuse here for yourself. So that's all about the stencil library. Next time, we'll talk about embedding images into your documents. [* ](https://youtu.be/aSgcbfspvfo?t=0)
