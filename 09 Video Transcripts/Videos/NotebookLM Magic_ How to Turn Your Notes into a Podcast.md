# Content
hey everyone, it's Zsolt here, and from cohort 11 of the visual thinking workshop introduced me to Google's NotebookLM over the weekend, and I was so blown away by what this tool can do that I thought I would share with you. So, the first part of this video is going to be a podcast generated by NotebookLM, or Gemini, based on the full script of the visual thinking workshop, and then I'll come back at the end and I'll show you a bit behind the scenes of how I created this podcast. So first of all, enjoy the podcast! Be blown away; I think it is just unreal. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=0)

Unbelievable! It is so helpful, so realistic; I really cannot find words. So enjoy the podcast, and see you at the other end of the podcast. Ever get that sinking feeling? You know, like you've read tons of articles, highlighted the important stuff, and even taken notes, but then when you need that one crucial piece of information, poof, it's gone, vanished into thin air? Yeah, I know that feeling! Today, we're diving deep into a visual thinking workshop. Okay, it's all built around this framework they call it the mindset, and it claims to totally revolutionize how we learn and think. It's a pretty common struggle, right? Especially these days with so much information overload, our traditional text-based methods, they kind of fall short; our brains just aren't wired for linear note-taking, you know? [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=4)

So walk me through it, what's happening in our brains when we try to learn something new? Well, imagine instead of neat little files in a cabinet, knowledge is more like this giant web of interconnected ideas. Okay? And when we learn something new, it's got to find its place in that web, right? It needs to link up with what we already know. So basically, trying to cram this multi-dimensional web onto a flat piece of paper with linear notes isn't just going to cut it exactly; we lose all the depth, the richness, the connections that make knowledge stick. It’s like the difference between looking at a long, boring receipt versus experiencing a visually stunning storefront display. Right? That's a great way to put it; you get the whole picture, the relationships, the overall feel instantly. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=19)

Okay, that makes sense, but why this specific workshop? Can't I just Google visual thinking and figure it out myself? Sure, you can definitely explore on your own, and there's a ton of stuff out there. But this workshop gives you a structured path, like a guide leading you through unfamiliar territory. I see, so you don't get lost. Plus, you're learning alongside a community of people, you know, sharing insights and supporting each other. There's that saying, if you want to go fast, go alone; but if you want to go far, go together. Exactly! And this workshop is all about going far with visual thinking; it really wants you to embed this as a new way of thinking. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=49)

And it's based on solid science too, right? Absolutely! It uses Annie Murphy Paul's book, *The Extended Mind*, as its core text, which dives into these things called cognitive loops and how using visual tools can supercharge our thinking. So it's not just about pretty pictures; it's about tapping into how our brain works best! Exactly! It's about learning effectively. But let's be real, who has time for another workshop? Yeah, right? We're all juggling so much already. What would you say to someone who's worried about the time commitment? Well, the workshop does take dedication: about 12.5 hours for the video lessons and another, I think, 23.5 for homework and reading *The Extended Mind*. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=83)

But honestly, it's more of an investment. You know, you're not just learning a new skill; you're changing how you learn and think entirely. It's about developing a new mindset, a new lens for seeing and processing information precisely, and this goes beyond any specific tools. Yeah, it gives you a framework that works regardless of the tools you prefer—pen and paper, whiteboards, or those fancy digital tools like Readwise, Excalidraw, or Obsidian. The principles stay the same. That's good to know, especially for people intimidated by tech. But I bet some folks are still skeptical, right? Sure! What are some common arguments against this type of workshop? [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=191)

Well, a common one is that visual thinking takes too much time, that it's just another layer of complexity in an already overwhelming world. But the irony is, it actually makes you more efficient in the long run! Oh, by processing information visually, you absorb and retain it faster, so you save time down the road. So, working smarter, not harder, by harnessing our brain's natural visual processing power? Exactly! Another myth is that visual thinking is only for creative types, right? But honestly, it's a cognitive skill that benefits everyone! It's about making complex stuff clear and accessible, no matter your profession or interests. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=266)

This sounds like a game changer, but are there other programs out there with a similar approach? What makes this one stand out? There are definitely other visual thinking and note-taking programs out there, yeah, but what's unique about this workshop is the blend of science-backed methods, practical techniques, and that supportive community aspect. So it's more than just tools; it's about cultivating that mindset. Exactly! That new way of approaching information is what makes it compelling, absolutely! It helps you learn more effectively, solve problems creatively, and communicate your ideas clearly. Plus, you get access to this demo vault; it's full of examples, notes, and templates from the instructor's own work, giving you a behind-the-scenes look at how a pro visual thinker operates. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=304)

That's fantastic! It's like having a mentor guiding you. Okay, we've talked about the big picture and addressed some initial concerns. Now, let's get into the specifics. What techniques does this workshop offer? Sure! Let's start with reading workflows, okay? They're active reading strategies designed to transform how you engage with text and really extract meaning from it. Oh, this is where it gets interesting! So, tell us what these reading workflows are and how they differ from our usual highlighting and underlining routine. Alright, so the workshop covers three main reading workflows: sequential, iterative, and systemic. Each one is geared toward different learning styles and goals. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=359)

Okay, I'm listening. Walk me through these workflows, right? What makes one unique? So imagine you're tackling a really dense, challenging book, right? Yeah, sequential reading is like your trusty guide taking you through it step by step. You highlight key points, jot down notes, and summarize as you go, making sure you're really engaging with the text. So it's about being more intentional and focused rather than just passively absorbing information. Exactly! Now let's say you really want to internalize the ideas, wrestle with them, and make them your own. That's where iterative reading comes in; it's all about repeated cycles of reading, reflecting, taking notes, even sketching. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=377)

You might focus on a chapter, a section, or even a single paragraph, depending on the complexity. Well, it sounds almost like a dialogue with the text, like a back and forth exchange. That's a great way to put it! You're peeling back the layers, uncovering the nuances, and making connections you wouldn't see on a first read. Okay, so we've got the step-by-step of sequential and the deeper dive of iterative; what about the third workflow? Systemic reading is like your bird's eye view, okay? The panoramic lens helps you grasp the whole landscape of the book. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=414)

Okay, you do some pre-reading, skim for themes, then go through it multiple times, creating deep summaries that capture not just the individual ideas but the author's overall argument. So if sequential is about understanding the trees and iterative is examining the leaves, then systemic is about appreciating the whole forest. Precisely! It’s about seeing the big picture, the core message, and how the individual parts contribute to the whole. That makes perfect sense! It's like having a toolkit of reading strategies, each one for a different purpose. Yeah, but reading is just the first step, right? [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=446)

Right! How does the workshop help us organize and synthesize all this information we're gathering? That's where the idea integration board, or IIB, comes into play. It's this dynamic visual workspace where you collect all your notes, summaries, sketches, even links to external resources related to a specific book or project. So instead of scattered notes, everything is centralized and visually connected? Exactly! Think of it as a visual command center, allowing you to see the big picture and navigate your knowledge in a nonlinear way. And to further enhance your understanding and explore those relationships between ideas, there's the idea atlas. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=489)

Okay, I've heard of mind maps. What exactly is an idea atlas? It uses mind maps and concept maps to visually represent your knowledge. Imagine branching out from a central idea, connecting related concepts, adding visual cues—even keywords and questions to trigger further exploration. So it's like creating a personalized map of a knowledge domain, highlighting the key landmarks and pathways? That's a great analogy! It's about making those connections that might not be obvious from just text, sparking new insights, revealing the structure of your knowledge. This is making me rethink my entire note-taking system! [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=528)

It's not just about capturing information but creating a visual representation that aids understanding and sparks ideas. Precisely! And to distill the essence of a book or complex topic, there's the visual summary, often called a book on a page, or BoP. You're telling me I can summarize an entire book visually on one page? That's the challenge and the beauty of it! Wow! You capture the key ideas, arguments, and insights in a way that's visually engaging, memorable, and even aesthetically pleasing! So it's like a visual index, highlighting the most important features of the book? Exactly! You're not getting lost in the details, but focusing on the essence—the core you want to remember. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=569)

And speaking of focusing on the essential, there's the card forcing function. Forcing function? What's the forcing here, and how do cards come into play? It's designed to combat information overload by forcing you to condense complex ideas into simple, concise visual cards. You choose a key concept, represent it visually, and add a brief explanation, cutting through the clutter and getting to the core. So it's a mental workout, making your brain synthesize and simplify? Exactly! You're creating a visual shorthand for complex ideas, making them easier to grasp, remember, and connect. I can see how this would be great for presentations, brainstorming, even just clarifying your own thinking! [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=604)

Right? We've talked about distilling and summarizing; what about the note-taking itself? How does the workshop transform that? It encourages moving beyond linear text-based notes and embracing the visual Zettelkasten. Hold on, Zettelkasten? Me a translation for those of us not fluent in note-taking jargon? The traditional Zettelkasten is a network of interconnected notes, like a web of ideas linked together. This workshop adds a visual layer, integrating sketches, diagrams, and other visual elements right into your notes! So it's not just capturing information in words but enriching it with visuals, making it come alive? [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=648)

Precisely! You create a dynamic, multi-dimensional representation of your knowledge that enhances comprehension, creativity, and recall. And to make those connections between ideas even more explicit, there's the concept of link and think icons. Link and think icons? Tell me more. What are they, and how do they work? Imagine you're working on a project about, let's say, the future of transportation. Okay? You might have a note about electric vehicles, another about urban planning, and another about AI. Link and think icons are visual symbols you can use to connect these related notes, creating a visual map of associations. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=691)

So instead of relying on just keywords or internal links, you use icons to create a visual language of connections? Exactly! It's about making your thinking visible, externalizing those connections, and creating a system you can intuitively navigate. This is turning your notes into a dynamic, interconnected web of knowledge. And to make those connections even more powerful, you can Lego Wiiz your ideas. Lego Wiiz? Okay, now you've got me curious. What does it mean to Lego Wiiz an idea? Think about Lego bricks; you can break down a complex structure, analyze the individual pieces, and reassemble them in tons of new ways, right? [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=735)

Right? Legalized ideas are similar; it's about deconstructing complex visuals into smaller, reusable components, so breaking down ideas into their visual building blocks, allowing for more flexibility and creativity in how we represent and connect them. You got it! You develop a visual vocabulary that you can use to build new representations, explore different perspectives, and even communicate complex ideas in a more accessible way. This is mind-blowing! But how does all of this apply in real life? We've talked a lot about reading and note-taking, but how does it translate to other forms of learning? [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=776)

That's where the Noma method comes in! It's a really powerful approach to note-making that aligns perfectly with visual thinking. Okay, another new term! What's the Noma method, and how does it fit in? Noma stands for note-making. It emphasizes active engagement with ideas over passive note-taking. Instead of just copying stuff down, you ask questions, make connections, draw visual representations, and reflect on the material as you go. So it's about treating note-taking as a dynamic process, using visual tools to enhance understanding and capture insights? [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=790)

Exactly! You're integrating visual thinking into the entire note-taking process, not just as an afterthought. This is starting to click for me! It's not about choosing between text and visuals, but using both to create a richer representation of knowledge. Precisely! It's about using the right tool for the job, knowing that sometimes a simple sketch can convey more than a paragraph. Okay, I'm inspired, but also a bit overwhelmed by this information! Yeah, I get it! With so many techniques and tools, doesn't it get overwhelming? It's a valid concern, but the workshop gives you a structured approach, guiding you through each step and showing you how to integrate these techniques into your workflow. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=819)

Okay, it's not about using every single technique but experimenting and finding what works for you. That makes sense: personalizing the approach and building a system you can actually stick with. Exactly! And to streamline your workflow and boost efficiency, there's automation, particularly using a tool called Templ. You mentioned that with those visual Zettelkasten notes, right? Remind me, what is it, and how does it work? Yeah, Templ is a plugin for Obsidian that lets you create templates for your notes, automate repetitive tasks, and even insert dynamic content. Imagine having a pre-designed template for your concept cards, mind maps, even your book on a page—ready to go with a few keystrokes! [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=867)

So it's like having visual building blocks to create notes efficiently and consistently? Precisely! It eliminates the formatting hassle and lets you focus on the content—the ideas themselves. That's a huge time saver! But we're in the age of AI—how does the workshop incorporate those new technologies? It introduces the Excalidraw writing machine, which uses visual thinking to actually enhance your writing process. That sounds like something out of a sci-fi novel! I know, right? But it's a real game changer! Imagine taking your visual notes, sketches, mind maps, and transforming them into a structured written draft; almost like magic! [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=906)

Wait, you can take a messy visual brainstorm and turn it into coherent writing? Exactly! The Excalidraw writing machine is a script that analyzes your visual notes arranged like comic strip panels, extracts the text from each element, and stitches it all together into a cohesive draft. That's incredible! A dream come true for anyone who struggles with writer's block, especially if they think visually! It's a bridge between visual thinking and writing, making it easier to get those visual ideas into written form. Wow! And if you want to take it even further, you can integrate ChatGPT into the mix. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=948)

Okay, now we're talking future-forward learning! How does ChatGPT enhance this visual writing process? ChatGPT is like your AI writing assistant. Okay? Once you've got a draft using the Excal writing machine, you can feed it into ChatGPT to refine and polish your writing, improve the grammar, style, and flow. This is next-level stuff! It's like having a whole team of collaborators, human and AI, helping you unlock your creative potential. It's about using tech to boost our natural cognitive abilities, taking visual thinking to a whole new level. This is all so inspiring but I have to admit, a bit overwhelming! Before we jump into real-world examples, let's take a moment to process everything. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1003)

When we come back, we'll explore how this mindset is applied in different fields—from art and literature to business and technology. Stay with us! Welcome back! So, are you ready to see how these visual thinking techniques we've talked about are actually being used in the real world? Yeah, definitely! Seeing it in action is always helpful; it gives it all a bit more context! So what are some examples? Like, how are people using visual thinking to solve problems or communicate ideas or even create art? Well, let's start with a really unique example that kind of pushes the boundaries of language! New Bing's book *From the Crown*; it's a whole story told entirely in emojis! Whoa, emojis?! That's wild! [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1012)

I can't even imagine trying to tell a complex story using only emojis! Like, how do you convey emotions, or plot twists, or character development with just those little pictures? It's a real challenge, for sure! But it just shows you the power of visual communication! You know that old saying, "A picture is worth a thousand words?" In this case, a series of emojis can tell a whole story! It makes the reader think differently, decipher those visual cues, and create meaning in a new way. It makes you wonder about the future of reading in a world that's so visual! Absolutely! And speaking of the future, let's look at innovation and technology: Elon Musk, you know, the guy behind SpaceX and Tesla? [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1031)

Oh yeah, he's always stressing how important it is to condense information into a visual, actionable form! Yeah, that makes sense, especially in those fast-paced environments where every second counts; a clear visual can communicate so much more than pages of text! Exactly! It leads to quicker decision-making and problem-solving. He believes that clear communication is all about distilling those complex ideas down to their essence visually so they're easy to grasp and act on. And that applies beyond the tech world too, right? Like that old saying, "A picture is worth a thousand words?" [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1073)

Exactly! That principle is at work everywhere, especially in creative fields! Think about the creators of *South Park,* Trey Parker and Matt Stone; their secret weapon is using the words "therefore" and "but" strategically in their storytelling. Wait, what? Those two little words can have that much impact? Oh yeah! They create these causal connections and unexpected turns in the narrative. So instead of just a flat sequence of events, you get consequence, momentum, even humor! So instead of "this happened, and then this happened," it's more like, "this happened; therefore, this happened, but then this other thing happened." [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1118)

Exactly! It keeps things dynamic and unpredictable! And this idea of visual flow applies to more than just animation! Scott McCloud in his book *Understanding Comics* talks about panel transitions and how they guide the reader's eye, creating a sense of movement in a static medium! So it's not just about the individual images, but about how they're arranged and connected to create the narrative. Exactly! The order of the panels, the types of transitions—all contribute to the impact of the story, like choreography but for visuals! Love that analogy! And these principles can be applied to so much more than comics! Think presentations, data visualization, website design; it's all about understanding how visuals guide attention and understanding! [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1152)

It's amazing; it's like I'm seeing the world in a whole new way! Like, visuals are everywhere! They are! And the more you practice visual thinking, the more intuitive it becomes! So as we wrap up, what's the one big takeaway you want listeners to walk away with? What's the promise of embracing this visual mindset? Imagine having a visual index of your knowledge—a dynamic library of ideas and connections that you can effortlessly explore and play with! That's the power of visual thinking, unlocking a deeper level of understanding, creativity, and problem-solving! Like a mental map that guides you through the maze of information? Right, exactly! And the visual thinking workshop gives you the tools and techniques to build that map! [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1199)

This has been eye-opening! It's not just about a new skill set; it's a new way of seeing and interacting with the world! Yeah! It's realizing that we all have the potential to be visual thinkers and leverage those images to boost our understanding and creativity! Exactly! To see learning as this adventure full of aha moments and unexpected connections! That's a great way to put it! Well, listeners, we encourage you to check out the visual thinking workshop for yourself! The journey of visual thinking is a fascinating one, and we're confident you'll discover a world of possibilities you never knew existed! Thanks for joining us on this deep dive! Keep those minds open and those ideas flowing! So what do you think? [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1228)

I think this is just simply amazing! I really struggle to find verses! But let me show you how I did this. So all you need to do is go to notebooklm.google.com, and you need to log on with your Google account, and then you can create notebooks. I created—I actually created multiple notebooks in a different account because after a time I ran out of three generations, and then I used a different Google account to continue on with experimenting. By the way, NotebookLM at the moment is free of charge! They might have a pricing later on, and the generation limits are super generous! But let me show you how a notebook looks like. So this is how my notebook looks like. What you see on the left-hand side are PDF documents that I uploaded; these are the transcripts of my course plus some additional materials. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1273)

Here, NotebookLM can process up to 50—that is 5 different documents—and each document can be 200,000 words long, which is almost 60,000 words more than what ChatGPT can handle per book! And you can have 50 of those. And then, when you have all of your material in one place, you can start to chat with the material. So for example, I can ask NotebookLM what are the key concepts in the course? So let me just ask this, and what NotebookLM does is it provides you a very succinct, to-the-point response with key references to where the questions come from. So here I can see it's about visual thinking, it's about personal knowledge management, it's about the mindset framework, and here you can see that you'll find the reference in the source material. Exactly, reference! So this is just simply awesome! [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1290)

What I found is, of course, it's AI; it's not 100% foolproof, but it is pretty good! So this is one part, but this is not how I generated the podcast. For the podcast, you need to click here on Notebook Guide, and I've already generated a podcast. So once you've generated a podcast, you can play that podcast, or you can download it. And of course, you can change the playback speed and so on. But if you want to generate a different podcast—because you can prompt the podcast with your questions, and then it will generate a different type of podcast. So for example, what I did now is I went through my course, and for each chapter in the course, I prompted it to provide a quick, around 10-minute summary for that chapter, and I added it to my course so that people who buy the course will not only listen to me and go through the exercises and practice visual thinking, but they get this additional tool of summarization. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1304)

And each summary is about the specific items discussed in the chapter. But let me show you how you can change the prompt! So if I come here and click delete, I need to delete. So I can only have one podcast at a time, but of course, as I show you, I can download it. So let me just click cancel. So before deleting it, if you like the podcast, you can download it, then you need to delete it. And after you delete it, you can either generate the podcast or you can customize the prompt, and you have 500 characters here. But again, you can customize this, and 500 characters are a pretty significant guidance, and you can see here what you can prompt it to focus on specific source, specific topic, specific audience. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1342)

So provide an executive summary of the course, I think that's, for example, something that you might want to do. So I like that. And if I click generate, it will start generating. Now, it takes a bit of time; it takes a few minutes, but it's surprisingly fast! And while it's generating, I just want to mention one more thing. The material you upload—it can be text documents. So for example, I can upload Markdown documents from my Obsidian vault. These can be PDF documents, but also, these can be audio files! So you have good flexibility of what you can upload here! For example, I also played with converting an epub into markdown, an EPUB book, uploading it here, and then creating a podcast about that book, which worked fantastic! [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1364)

I'm going to link to a video where I explain how I convert eBooks into markdown notes! So you can find the link in the description below. Following a similar process, you can convert your EPUB into markdown and then upload it to NotebookLM and generate a podcast to get an overview, understanding, or to focus in on a specific subject. Or you can place two books here, and you can ask for a comparative podcast about the two books. The options, the opportunities are endless! And with Google support, you can upload material in 50 different languages, but the podcast can only be in English, so I think that's a fair limitation. [* ](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1418)

So now let's wait for the podcast to finish, and then we'll listen just very shortly to the beginning of that podcast. And with that, we're going to end! So I'm saying goodbye here once the podcast is finished! I'm going to hit play; we're going to listen to it! And I hope to see you in the next video, or I hope to see you—or maybe, and/or—I hope to see you at the Visual Thinking Workshop as well! Links are in the description below! Thank you!

## YouTube Transcript

[hey everyone it's jolt here andd from](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=0) [cohort 11 of the visual thinking](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=4) [Workshop introduced me to Google's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=6) [notebook LM over the weekend and I was](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=9) [so blown away by what this tool can do](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=13) [that I thought I would share with you so](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=16) [the first part of this video is going to](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=19) [be a podcast generated by notebook LM or](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=22) [Gemini based on the full script of the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=27) [visual thinking workshop and then I'll](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=31) [come back at the end and I'll show you a](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=34) [bit behind the scenes of how I created](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=36) [this podcast so first of all enjoy the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=40) [podcast B be blown away I think it is](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=43) [just unreal](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=46) [unbelievable it is so helpful so](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=49) [realistic I I really cannot find wordss](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=53) [so enjoy the podcast and see at the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=57) [other end of the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=60) [podcast ever get that sinking feeling](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=62) [you know like you've read tons of](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=65) [Articles highlighted the important stuff](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=67) [even taking notes M but then when you](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=69) [need that one crucial piece of](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=72) [information poof it's gone vanished Into](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=75) [Thin Air yeah I know that feeling today](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=78) [we're diving deep into a visual thinking](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=81) [Workshop okay it's all built around this](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=83) [framework they call it the mindset and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=86) [it claims to totally revolutionize how](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=89) [we learn and think it's a pretty common](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=91) [struggle right especially these days](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=93) [with so much information overload our](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=95) [traditional text-based methods they kind](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=97) [of fall short our brains just aren't](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=99) [wired for linear note taking you know so](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=101) [walk me through it what's happening in](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=104) [our brains when we try to learn](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=106) [something new well imagine instead of](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=107) [neat little files in a cabinet knowledge](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=110) [is more like this giant web of](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=112) [interconnected ideas okay and when we](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=114) [learn something new it's got to find its](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=116) [place in that web right needs to link up](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=118) [with what we already know so basically](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=120) [trying to cram this multi-dimensional](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=122) [web onto a flat piece of paper M with](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=124) [linear notes it's just not going to cut](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=128) [it exactly we lose all the depth the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=129) [richness the connections that make](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=133) [knowledge stick it's like the difference](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=135) [between looking at a long boring receipt](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=136) [oh yeah experiencing a visually stunning](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=139) [storefront display right that's a great](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=143) [way to put it you get the whole picture](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=145) [the relationships the overall feel](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=147) [instantly](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=149) [okay that makes sense but why this](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=150) [specific Workshop right can't I just](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=154) [Google visual thinking and figure it out](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=156) [myself sure you can definitely explore](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=158) [on your own and there's a ton of stuff](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=160) [out there but this Workshop gives you a](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=162) [structured path like a guide leading you](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=164) [through unfamiliar territory I see so](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=166) [you don't get lost plus you're learning](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=169) [alongside a community of people you know](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=171) [sharing insights and supporting each](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=173) [other there's that saying if you want to](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=174) [go fast go alone but if you want to go](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=176) [far go to together exactly and this](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=178) [Workshop is all about going far with](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=181) [visual thinking it really wants you to](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=184) [embed this as a new way of thinking and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=186) [it's based on solid science too right](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=188) [absolutely it uses Annie Murphy Paul's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=191) [book the extended mind as its core text](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=193) [which dives into these things called](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=197) [cognitive loops and how using visual](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=199) [tools can supercharge our thinking so](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=202) [it's not just about pretty pictures it's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=205) [about tapping into how our brain work](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=207) [best exactly it's about learning](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=210) [effectively but let's be real who has](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=212) [time for another Workshop yeah right](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=214) [we're all juggling so much already what](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=217) [would you say to someone who's worried](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=219) [about the time commitment well the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=221) [workshop does take dedication about 12](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=223) [and 1 half hours for the video lessons](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=226) [and another I think 23 and a half for](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=227) [homework and reading the extended mind](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=229) [but honestly it's more of an investment](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=232) [you know you're not just learning a new](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=234) [skill but changing how you learn and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=235) [think entirely it's about developing a](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=237) [new mindset a new lens for seeing and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=239) [processing information precisely and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=241) [this goes beyond any specific tools yeah](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=243) [it gives you a framework that works](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=245) [regardless of the tools you prefer pen](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=247) [and paper whiteboards or those fancy](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=249) [digital tools like readwise excal draw](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=251) [or obsidian the principles stay the same](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=254) [that's good to know especially for](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=257) [people intimidated by Tech but I bet](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=259) [some folks are still skeptical sure what](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=261) [are some common arguments against this](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=264) [type of Workshop H well a common one is](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=266) [that visual thinking takes too much time](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=269) [that it's just another layer of](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=272) [complexity in an already overwhelming](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=273) [World But the irony is it actually makes](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=276) [you more efficient in the long run Oh by](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=278) [processing information visually you](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=281) [absorb and retain it faster so you save](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=283) [time down the road so working smarter](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=285) [not harder by harnessing our brain's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=287) [natural visual processing power exactly](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=290) [another myth is that visual thinking is](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=292) [only for Creative types right but](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=294) [honestly it's a cognitive skill that](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=296) [benefits everyone mm it's about making](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=298) [complex stuff clear and accessible no](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=300) [matter your profession or interests this](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=302) [sounds like a GameChanger but are there](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=304) [other programs out there with the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=306) [similar approach what makes this one](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=307) [stand out there are definitely other](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=309) [visual thinking and note-taking programs](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=312) [out there yeah but what's unique about](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=314) [this Workshop is the blend of](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=316) [science-backed methods practical](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=317) [techniques and that supportive Community](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=320) [aspect so it's more than just tools it's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=322) [about cultivating that mindset exactly](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=324) [that new way of approaching information](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=327) [is what makes it compelling absolutely](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=329) [it helps you learn more effectively](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=330) [solve problems creatively and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=332) [communicate your ideas clearly plus you](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=334) [get access to this demo Vault it's full](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=337) [of examples notes and templates from the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=339) [instructor's own work giving you a](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=341) [behindthescenes look at how a pro visual](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=343) [thinker operates that's fantastic it's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=346) [like having a mentor guiding you oh okay](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=348) [we've talked about the big picture and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=351) [addressed some initial concerns now](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=352) [let's get into the specifics what](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=354) [techniques does this Workshop offer sure](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=356) [let's start with reading workflows okay](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=359) [they're active reading strategies](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=360) [designed to transform how you engage](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=362) [with text and really extract meaning](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=364) [from it oh this is where it gets](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=366) [interesting so tell us what are these](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=368) [reading workflows and how are they](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=370) [different from our usual highlighting](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=372) [and underlining routine all right so the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=374) [workshop covers three main reading](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=377) [workflows okay sequential iterative and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=379) [systemic each one is kind of geared](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=382) [toward different learning styles and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=384) [goals okay I'm listening walk me through](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=386) [these workflows right what makes one](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=388) [unique so imagine you're tackling a](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=389) [really dense challenging book right yeah](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=393) [sequential reading is like your trusty](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=395) [guide taking you through it step by step](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=397) [you highlight key points jot down notes](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=400) [and summarize as you go making sure](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=402) [you're really engaging with the text so](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=404) [it's about being more intentional and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=407) [focused rather than just passively](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=408) [absorbing information exactly now let's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=410) [say you really want to internalize the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=413) [ideas wrestle with them and make them](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=414) [your own that's where iterative reading](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=417) [comes comes in it's all about repeated](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=419) [cycles of reading reflecting taking](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=421) [notes even sketching you might focus on](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=423) [a chapter a section even a single](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=426) [paragraph depending on the complexity](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=428) [well it sounds almost like a dialogue](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=430) [with the text like a back and forth](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=431) [exchange that's a great way to put it](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=433) [you're peeling back the layers](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=434) [uncovering the nuances and making](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=436) [connections you wouldn't see on a first](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=438) [read Okay so we've got the step-by-step](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=439) [of sequential and the deeper dive of](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=441) [iterative what about the third workflow](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=443) [systemic reading is like your bird's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=446) [eyee view okay the panoramic lens that](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=448) [helps you grasp the whole landscape of](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=450) [the book okay you do some pre-reading](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=452) [skim for Te themes then go through it](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=455) [multiple times creating deep summaries](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=458) [that capture not just the individual](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=461) [ideas but the author's overall argument](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=463) [so if sequential is about understanding](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=466) [the trees and iterative is examining the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=468) [leaves then systemic is about](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=471) [appreciating the whole Forest precisely](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=473) [it's about seeing the big picture the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=476) [core message and how the individual](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=478) [Parts contribute to the whole that makes](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=480) [perfect sense it's like having a toolkit](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=482) [of reading strategies each one for a](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=484) [different purpose yeah but reading is](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=486) [just the first step right right how does](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=487) [the workshop help us organize and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=489) [synthesize all this information we're](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=491) [Gathering that's where the idea](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=493) [integration board or iib comes into play](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=495) [it's this Dynamic visual workspace where](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=498) [you collect all your notes summaries](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=501) [sketches even links to external](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=503) [resources related to a specific book or](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=505) [project so instead of scattered notes](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=508) [everything is centralized and Visually](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=510) [connected exactly think of it as a](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=512) [visual Command Center allowing you to](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=514) [see the big picture and navigate your](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=516) [knowledge in a nonlinear way and to](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=518) [further enhance your understanding and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=521) [explore those relationships between](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=523) [ideas there's the idea Atlas okay I've](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=524) [heard of mind maps what exactly is an](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=528) [idea Atlas it uses mind maps and concept](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=530) [maps to visually represent your](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=533) [knowledge imagine branching out from a](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=534) [central idea connecting related Concepts](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=536) [adding visual cues even keywords and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=539) [questions to trigger further exploration](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=541) [so it's like creating a personalized map](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=543) [of a knowledge domain highlighting

these](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=708) [related notes creating a visual map of](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=709) [associations so instead of relying on](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=712) [just keywords or internal links you use](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=714) [icons to create a visual language](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=717) [anguage of connections exactly it's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=719) [about making your thinking visible](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=721) [externalizing those connections and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=723) [creating a system you can intuitively](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=725) [navigate this is turning your notes into](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=727) [a dynamic interconnected Web of](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=729) [Knowledge and to make those connections](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=731) [even more powerful you can Lego wiiz](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=733) [your ideas Lego wiiz okay now you've got](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=735) [me curious what does it mean to Lego](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=737) [wiiz an idea think about Lego bricks you](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=739) [can break down a complex structure](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=742) [analyze the individual pieces and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=744) [reassemble them in tons of new ways](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=746) [right legalized ideas is similar it's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=748) [about deconstructing complex visuals](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=750) [into smaller reusable components so](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=752) [breaking down ideas into their visual](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=755) [building blocks allowing for more](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=757) [flexibility and creativity in how we](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=759) [represent and connect them you got it](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=761) [you develop a visual vocabulary that you](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=763) [can use to build new representations](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=765) [explore different perspectives and even](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=767) [communicate complex ideas in a more](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=769) [accessible way this is mindblowing but](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=771) [how does all of this apply in real life](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=774) [we've talked a lot about reading and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=776) [notetaking but how does it translate to](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=778) [other forms of learning that's where the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=780) [nma method comes in it's a really](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=782) [powerful approach to notem making that](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=784) [aligns perfectly with visual thinking](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=785) [okay another new term what's the Noma](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=788) [method and how does it fit in Noma](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=790) [stands for note making it emphasizes](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=791) [active engagement with ideas over](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=794) [passive note taking instead of just](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=795) [copying stuff down you ask questions](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=797) [make connections draw visual](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=800) [representations and reflect on the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=801) [material as you go so it's about](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=803) [treating note taking as a dynamic](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=805) [process using visual tools to en enhance](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=806) [understanding and capture insights](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=809) [exactly you're integrating visual](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=811) [thinking into the entire note-taking](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=813) [process not just as an afterthought this](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=816) [is starting to click for me it's not](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=818) [about choosing between text and visuals](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=821) [but using both to create a richer](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=823) [representation of knowledge precisely](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=826) [it's about using the right tool for the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=828) [job knowing that sometimes a simple](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=830) [sketch can convey more than a paragraph](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=833) [okay I'm inspired but also a bit](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=835) [overwhelmed by this information yeah I](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=838) [get it with so many techniques and tools](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=840) [doesn't it get overwhelming it's a valid](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=842) [concern but the workshop gives you a](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=844) [structured approach guiding you through](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=847) [each step and showing you how to](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=849) [integrate these techniques into your](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=851) [workflow okay it's not about using every](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=852) [single technique but experimenting and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=854) [finding what works for you that makes](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=857) [sense personalizing the approach and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=858) [building a system you can actually stick](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=860) [with exactly and to streamline your](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=862) [workflow and boost efficiency there's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=865) [automation particularly using tool](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=867) [called templ templ you mentioned that](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=869) [with those visual zle cast notes right](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=871) [remind me what is it and how does it](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=873) [work yeah templ is a plugin for obsidian](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=875) [that lets you create templates for your](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=878) [notes automate repetitive tasks and even](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=880) [insert Dynamic content imagine having a](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=883) [pre-designed template for your concept](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=885) [cards mind maps even your book on a page](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=887) [ready to go with a few keystrokes so](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=890) [it's like having visual building blocks](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=892) [to create notes efficiently and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=894) [consistently precisely it eliminates the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=896) [formatting Hassle and let you focus on](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=899) [the content the ideas themselves that's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=901) [a huge timesaver but we're in the age of](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=903) [AI how does the workshop incorporate](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=906) [those new technologies it introduces the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=908) [excal draw writing machine which uses](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=910) [visual thinking to actually enhance your](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=912) [writing process that sounds like](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=914) [something out of a Sci-Fi novel I know](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=916) [right but it's a real GameChanger](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=917) [imagine taking your visual notes](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=919) [sketches mind maps and transforming them](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=921) [into a structured written draft almost](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=923) [like magic wait you can take a messy](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=925) [visual brainstorm and turn into coherent](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=927) [writing exactly the excal draw writing](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=929) [machine is a script that analyzes your](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=932) [visual notes arranged like comic strip](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=934) [panels extracts the text from each](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=937) [element and stitches it all together](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=939) [into a cohesive draft that's incredible](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=941) [a dream come true for anyone who](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=944) [struggles with writer block especially](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=945) [if they think visually it's a bridge](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=948) [between visual thinking and writing](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=950) [making it easier to get those visual](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=952) [ideas into written form wow and if you](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=954) [want to take it even further you can](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=957) [integrate chat GPT into the mix okay now](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=959) [we're talking future forward learning](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=961) [how does chat GPT enhance this visual](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=963) [writing process chat GPT is like your AI](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=967) [writing assistant okay once you've got a](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=970) [draft using the excal writing machine](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=972) [you can feed it into chat GPT to refine](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=974) [and polish your writing improve the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=976) [grammar style and flow this is next](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=978) [level stuff it's like having a whole](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=980) [team of collaborators human and AI](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=982) [helping you unlock your creative](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=985) [potential it's about using Tech to to](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=987) [boost our natural cognitive abilities](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=989) [taking visual thinking to a whole new](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=991) [level this is all so inspiring but also](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=993) [I have to admit bit overwhelming before](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=996) [we jump into real world examples let's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=999) [take a moment to process everything when](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1001) [we come back we'll explore how this](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1003) [mindset is applied in different fields](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1005) [from art and literature to Business and](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1007) [Technology stay with us welcome back so](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1009) [are you ready to see how these visual](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1012) [thinking techniques we've talked about](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1014) [are actually being used in the real](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1015) [world yeah definitely seeing it in](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1017) [action is always helpful it gives it all](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1019) [bit more context so what are some](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1020) [examples like how are people using](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1023) [visual thinking to solve problems or](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1025) [communicate ideas or even create art](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1027) [well let's start with a really unique](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1030) [example that kind of pushes the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1031) [boundaries of language new Bings book](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1033) [from the crown it's a whole story told](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1035) [entirely in emojis whoa emojis that's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1037) [wild I can't even imagine trying to tell](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1040) [a complex story using only emojis like](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1042) [how do you convey emotions or plot](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1046) [twists or character development with](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1048) [just those little pictures it's a real](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1050) [challenge for sure but it just shows you](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1052) [the power of visual communication you](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1053) [know that old saying a picture is worth](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1055) [a thousand words in this case a series](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1056) [of emojis can tell a whole story it](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1058) [makes the reader think differently](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1061) [decipher those visual cues and create](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1063) [meaning in a new way it makes you wonder](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1065) [about the future of reading in a world](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1067) [that's so visual absolutely and speaking](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1069) [of the future let's look at Innovation](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1071) [and Technology Elon Musk you know the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1073) [guy behind SpaceX and Tesla oh yeah he's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1077) [always stressing how important it is to](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1079) [condense information into a visual](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1081) [actionable form yeah that makes sense](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1083) [especially in those fast-paced](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1086) [environments where every second counts a](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1087) [clear visual can communicate so much](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1090) [more than pages of text exactly it leads](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1092) [to quicker decision- making and problem](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1095) [solving he believes that clear](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1097) [communication is all about distilling](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1099) [those complex ideas down to their](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1101) [Essence visually so they're easy to](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1103)

[is a fascinating one and we're confident](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1256) [you'll discover a world of possibilities](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1259) [you never knew existed thanks

what do you](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1267) [think I think this is just simply](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1269) [amazing I really struggle to find vers](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1273) [but let me show you how I did this so](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1277) [all you need to do is you need to go to](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1279) [notebook lm. google.com and you need to](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1283) [log on with your Google account and then](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1287) [you can create notebooks I created I](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1290) [actually created multiple notebooks in a](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1293) [different account because after a time I](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1296) [ran out of three generations and then I](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1298) [used a different Google account to](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1302) [continue on with](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1304) [experimenting by the way notebook LM at](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1306) [the moment is free of](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1309) [charge they might have a pricing later](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1312) [on and the generation limits are](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1314) [super generous but so let me show you](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1319) [how a notebook looks like so this is how](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1321) [my notebook looks like what you see on](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1324) [the left hand side are PDF documents](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1326) [that I uploaded these are the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1330) [transcripts of my course plus some](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1332) [additional materials](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1336) [here notebook LM can process up to 50](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1338) [that is 5 different documents and each](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1343) [document can be 200,000 words long which](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1346) [is an almost 60,000 words more than what](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1350) [Chad GPT can handle per book and you can](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1354) [have 50 of those and then when you have](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1357) [all of your material in one place you](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1360) [can start to chat with the material so](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1363) [for example I can ask notebook LM what](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1366) [are the key](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1370) [Concepts in the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1374) [course so let me just ask this and what](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1376) [notebook LM does is it provides you a](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1380) [very](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1383) [succinct to the point](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1384) [response with key references to where](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1387) [the questions come from so here I can](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1391) [see it's about V visual thinking it's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1394) [about personal Knowledge Management it's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1397) [about the mindset framework and here you](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1399) [can see that you'll find the reference](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1401) [in the source material exactly reference](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1405) [so this is just simply awesome what I](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1409) [found is of course it's AI it's not 100%](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1412) [full safe but it is pretty good so this](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1417) [is one part but this is not how I](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1422) [generated the podcast for the podcast](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1424) [you need to click here on Notebook guide](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1427) [and I've already generated a podcast so](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1430) [once you've generated a podcast you can](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1433) [play that podcast or you can you can](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1435) [download it and of course you can change](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1438) [the playback speed and so on but if you](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1440) [want to generate a different podcast](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1443) [because you can prompt the podcast with](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1447) [your questions and then it will generate](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1450) [a different type of podcast so for](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1453) [example what I did now is I went through](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1455) [my course and for each chapter in the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1458) [course I prompted it to provide a quick](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1461) [round about 10 minutes summary for that](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1465) [chapter and I added it to my course so](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1467) [that people who buy the course will not](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1471) [only listen to me and goes through the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1474) [exercises and practice visual thinking](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1477) [but they get this additional tool of](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1480) [summarization and each summary is about](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1484) [the specific items discussed in the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1488) [chapter but so let me show you how you](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1490) [can change the prompt so if I come here](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1493) [and click delete](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1496) [I can I need to delete so I can only](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1498) [have one podcast at a time but of course](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1500) [as I show you I can download it so let](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1504) [me just click cancel so before deleting](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1506) [it if you like the podcast you can](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1509) [download it then you need to delete it](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1512) [and after you delete it you can either](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1515) [generate the podcast or you can](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1518) [customize the prompt and you have 500](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1521) [characters here but again you can](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1526) [customize this and 500 characters are a](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1528) [pretty significant guidance and you can](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1532) [see here uh what you can prompt it to to](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1536) [focus on specific Source specific topic](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1540) [specific audience so uh](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1543) [provide an](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1549) [executive summary of the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1552) [course I think that's for example](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1555) [something that uh you might want to do](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1560) [so like that and if I click generate it](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1564) [will start generating now it takes a bit](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1568) [of time it takes a few minutes but it's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1570) [surprisingly fast and while it's](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1573) [generating I just want to mention one](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1575) [more thing that the material you upload](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1577) [it can be text documents so for example](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1581) [I can upload markdown documents from my](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1585) [obsidian Vault these can be PDF](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1588) [documents but also these can be audio](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1591) [files so you have good flexibility of](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1594) [what you can upload here for example I](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1597) [also played with converting an Epub into](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1600) [markdown an UB book uploading it here](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1604) [and then creating a podcast about that](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1608) [book which worked fantastic I'm going to](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1611) [link to a video that where I explain how](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1613) [I convert books eot books into markdown](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1616) [noes so you can find the link in the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1620) [description below and following a](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1623) [similar process you can convert your](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1626) [ePub into markdown and then upload it to](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1628) [notebook LM and generate a podcast to](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1632) [get an overview understanding or to](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1635) [focus in on a specific subject or you](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1638) [can place two books here and you can ask](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1641) [for a comparative podcast about the two](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1644) [books the options the opportunities are](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1647) [endless and with Google supports you can](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1651) [upload material in 50 different](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1654) [languages but the podcast can only be in](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1657) [English so I think that's a fair](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1661) [limitation so now let's wait for the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1664) [podcast to finish and then we'll listen](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1667) [just very shortly to the beginning of](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1671) [that podcast and with that we're going](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1673) [to end so I'm saying goodbye here once](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1675) [the podcast is finished I'm going to hit](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1678) [play we're going to listen to it and I](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1680) [hope to see you in the next video or I](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1684) [hope to see you or maybe and or I hope](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1688) [to see you at the visual thinking](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1691) [Workshop as well links are in the](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1693) [description below thank](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1696) [you all right so uh we are going to do a](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1700) [deep dive into zel's visual thinking](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1704) [Workshop okay](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1707) [um this course has been getting a ton of](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1708) [Buzz yeah because it claims to change](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1711) [how you learn and think right and I can](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1713) [see why it's not about taking prettier](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1716) [notes it's not it's about rewiring how](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1718) [you process information](https://youtu.be/2ZvgOKmQY-4?t=1722)
