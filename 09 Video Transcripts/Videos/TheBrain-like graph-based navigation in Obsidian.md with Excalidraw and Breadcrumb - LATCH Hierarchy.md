![TheBrain-like graph-based navigation in Obsidian.md with Excalidraw and Breadcrumb - LATCH Hierarchy](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o)

# Summary
In this video, the creator discusses implementing a graph-based user interface in Obsidian using the Excalidraw plugin, inspired by the software 'TheBrain.' The video highlights the LATCH hierarchy method for organizing information, demonstrating how to visualize and navigate relationships between notes through parents, children, siblings, and links. Ultimately, the creator encourages viewers to explore the utility of this setup for enhancing their own knowledge management practices.

# Key Takeaways
- The creator uses Excalidraw in Obsidian to create a graph-like interface reminiscent of 'TheBrain' application.
- The LATCH hierarchy framework helps organize information through location, alphabet, time, category, and hierarchy.
- Breadcrumbs are essential for navigating the graph; however, they require proper setup and unique file names to function effectively.

# Content
Hi, I am super excited about today's video. I created a graph user interface for my Obsidian vault using my Excalidraw Obsidian plugin that resembles the graph interface of TheBrain application. You know this one? So how does this work? In the center, I have the central thought or object, which is the document that's currently open—in this case, the storyboard for my video today. You can see the storyboard right here. This storyboard or this topic has two parents; partly it is the YouTube channel map of content, and this is where I manage all of my YouTube projects on a Kanban board. I had a video on this—my YouTube workflow—couple of days ago. Then the other parent to this document is the hat rack that you can see right here on the screen. The hat rack is here because the graph interface is an example of the hierarchy aspect of LATCH. For those of you that are not familiar with what LATCH means, the term LATCH was coined by Richard Saul Wurman in his book *Information Anxiety*, and it stands for the five ways how you can organize information: location, alphabet, time, category, and hierarchy. I already shared some videos about the location aspect; it was a video about the map view and another video about fantasy maps of content. Recently, I published a video about time, how I'm managing the aspect of time in my meeting notes and daily notes, and today we are talking about hierarchy. This note also has some children; the children are the objects that are embedded. Well, actually, the LATCH object is embedded as well, but I specifically specified that LATCH should be apparent to this document. I'll show you in a bit how, so that's why it's shown as a parent. But you can see here this is the script engine icon, and then I have the Obsidian TheBrain thumbnail, which is this right here. This image is also embedded; it's not shown here because in the settings I disabled the attachments to show on my graph, but if I would turn that on, then that would show here as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=0)

On the right-hand side, you can see the siblings of the central thought, and these are my other videos on my Kanban board. On the left-hand side, these are the lateral moves—so-called jumps—using the Brain lingo. In this case, the storyboard on Obsidian is related to TheBrain. If I click TheBrain, then a similar mind map comes in. In this case, the right-hand side is quite busy because TheBrain is in my technology category, and I have lots of technology items there. But here on this other part of the graph, you can see that TheBrain is a type of mind mapping tool. If I open up my mind mapping tools category, you can see I have a set of different mind mapping tools here, and mind mapping is within the—or mind mapping tools are within the mind mapping category. Again, you can see that mind mapping is sort of similar to argument mapping and concept mapping, as well as sketchnoting, which is related to mind mapping because you can sketchnote a mind map. If I click on my sketchnoting MOC, then you can see my MOC page come up here with all sorts of notes. So that's the basic logic of how this works. [* ](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=45)

Let's take this example right here and understand how the various elements work on this page. First of all, my Brain user interface uses the breadcrumbs plugin, so you need to install the breadcrumbs plugin and configure it. All I'm doing is displaying this list of breadcrumbs in a structured manner using the Brain user interface. I have three types of relationships; breadcrumbs has a little more, and I'll explain the difference. I use three different relationships; I use the children relationship—in this case, the children are verbal to visual, quick draw, and so on. The parents—there's only one parent—are drawing and painting, and I have a couple of jumps here that you can see right here. The siblings are calculated. You can also notice I have two colors here. I actually have three types of colors on this chart. You can see two; the ones that are a bit more bluish are not breadcrumbs; they are links referenced in this document. You can turn this off and only see the breadcrumbs. In this case, or for me, I like to see all of the links, and the links that don't have a breadcrumb—the logic will be if it is a backlink, then it will be apparent; if it is a link, then it's going to be a child. Let's go back to today's storyboard and understand a bit more about this setup. As I've mentioned already, the Brain navigation is a form of organizing and navigating your hierarchy in your graph. I'm using breadcrumbs to visualize my vault, and breadcrumbs recognizes directions. Indeed, you need to set up hierarchies in breadcrumb settings. If you come here to breadcrumbs, you can open up the hierarchies settings, and you can see that this is the hierarchy that I've set up. I have various upward relations—parents, yesterday, and this week. I have siblings that I actually don't specifically highlight. You can also specify here that the same parent is siblings, so if I share a parent, then that is considered a sibling. I turned this on, and then I have children, and tomorrow are the downward relationships, and the lateral relationship are jump and previous, but I'm only using the jumps. Also, in the Brain interface, I'm not showing the two directions; I'm only showing jumps and previous together on the left-hand side. [* ](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=90)

Now, you can say troubleshooting, but things to keep in mind when you're using breadcrumbs: you will probably need to initialize the index before you start to use the Brain user interface. You can do this by opening the matrix view of breadcrumbs and clicking on refresh index. Once you've done that and you start the Brain interface—I'll show you in a second how to do that—then the whole setup is going to work. Breadcrumbs is a bit complex. I do recommend reading about the settings and the logic, but once you get the hang of it, it is a very well-developed plugin, and I'm pretty sure you're going to enjoy it. Finally, this is a limitation, and I hope eventually this limitation will go away, but breadcrumbs assumes unique file names. That means that when you have files with the same name but in different folders, in breadcrumbs you will not be able to distinguish between them, which causes a bit of a problem. I’ve started to rename my files so they are unique, but also I plan to work with the developer of breadcrumbs to sort this out and have an option to use unique file names as defined by the complete file path. [* ](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=135)

As mentioned, this whole setup is inspired by TheBrain, and I highly recommend that you try out TheBrain if you like this sort of graph interface. Once again, this is the logic of how the nodes appear on the graph view: you have the central node in the center, you have the children below, the parents above, the jumps on the left-hand side, and the siblings on the right-hand side in the graph view. This script is available in the Excalidraw script engine store, and what you need to pay attention to is that the script will overwrite the active drawing. The way you start the script—and let me show you how you would start—in a blank setting, you open a new document, you click on the Obsidian icon, and you click the icon of the Brain interface, which is this icon. For you, it's going to show under downloaded scripts and not under user scripts; it's in user scripts because I'm now using a local copy of this file because I'm still editing it. When I click this, a short-lived message came up telling me that I should open a document on the left-hand side, and that was already done. It also reminded me that I should refresh the breadcrumbs index, and from here on, this is going to work. You click the items, and the documents open up, or you click the documents, and the related graph opens here on the right-hand side. An additional cool feature is if you switch from view mode back to edit mode and you click the button again, you see this message up here: “Brain graph is off." This means that now the graph is not running anymore, so if I navigate, for example, to this document, this will stay as is. You can edit this to your liking because this is now an Excalidraw drawing with these documents as links. So these are actually individual links right here. You can see and do whatever you want in terms of changing this drawing. You can change the color of it, you can draw on it; this is now a normal Excalidraw drawing. But when you turn the script engine on again, or the Brain graph engine on again, this drawing is going to disappear, and it automatically turns into this automatically generated graph. If you don't like the colors I've set up here, you can go to Excalidraw settings, and every script can have settings. This has quite a number of settings, so if you scroll to the bottom of the list, you will see here this is the Brain-like interface; I call it Brainplex, but it will have a slightly different name in the store. Anyway, you will find it, and you can see all the different settings. For example, I have hide attachments and infer non-breadcrumb links turned on, as well as you can change the font type. Let's say I want handwritten fonts, and I want a bit rougher edges. I actually want sharp rectangles. Now, if I come back and re-initiate this graph view again, you can see that the graph view has changed, and now the lines are not so straight; they are a bit more sketchy, and the character or the font type or font face has changed. [* ](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=210)

Finally, I want to show you the source code as well—not because I want to explain it to you, just because this is the art of the possible. This is a script engine code, and if you're interested, you can also go and read the code; I'm pretty sure you will find things that you would do better, and I'm more than happy if you come back with some recommendations on how to make this code better. Let's close this discussion today just by showing you the storyboard for today. So what we talked about was the Brain-like interface for Obsidian, and this is inspired by TheBrain. This is an implementation of using the hierarchy as a navigation principle in your hold. As I mentioned earlier, the more ways you can access your knowledge in your world, the better you can reuse that information. So you should aim to implement methods along all five of these categories to access your data in the graph. We talked about the breadcrumbs and some of the limitations around it, and we talked about this warning that you need to pay attention to which document you initiate this script on because it will overwrite that document. However, there’s that additional feature that you can stop the script at any time, and you can simply use the drawing to customize it for your own purposes. I hope you enjoyed today's video. Thank you for watching, and hope to see you next time. Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=300)

side you can see](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=164) [the siblings of the central thought and](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=166) [these are my other videos on my kanban](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=169) [board and on the left hand side these](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=171) [are the lateral moves so-called jumps](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=174) [using the brain lingo and in this case](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=178) [the storyboard on obsidian the brain is](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=181) [related to the brain](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=185) [if i click the brain then a similar mind](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=186) [map comes in](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=190) [in this case the right hand side is](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=191) [quite busy because](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=193) [the brain is in my technology category](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=195) [and i have lots of technology items](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=198) [there but here on this other part of the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=201) [graph](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=204) [you can see that the brain is a type of](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=205) [mind mapping tool and if i open up my](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=208) [mind mapping tools category you can see](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=211) [i have a set of different mind mapping](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=214) [tools here and mind mapping is within](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=217) [the or mind mapping tools are within the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=220) [mind mapping](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=222) [category and again you can see that](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=224) [mind mapping is sort of similar to](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=227) [argument mapping and concept mapping as](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=230) [well as sketch noting is related to mind](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=233) [mapping because you can sketch note a](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=237) [mind map and if i click on my sketch](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=239) [loading moc](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=242) [then you can see my moc page come up](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=243) [here with all sorts of notes so that's](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=247) [the basic logic of how this works](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=250) [let's take this example right here and](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=252) [understand how the various elements work](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=255) [on this page so first of all](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=259) [my brain](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=262) [user interface uses the breadcrumbs](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=264) [plugin and so you need to install the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=267) [breadcrumbs plugin and configure it and](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=270) [all i'm doing is i'm](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=273) [displaying this list of breadcrumbs](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=275) [in this structured manner using the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=279) [brain user interface](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=282) [i have three types of relationships](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=284) [breadcrumbs has a little more and i'll](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=287) [explain you the difference](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=290) [so i use three different relationships i](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=293) [use the children relationship in this](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=296) [case the children are](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=298) [verbal to visual](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=300) [quick draw](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=303) [and so on](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=304) [the parents](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=305) [there's only one parent is drawing and](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=307) [painting and i have couple of jumps here](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=310) [that you can see right here the siblings](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=313) [are calculated you can also notice i](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=316) [have two colors here i actually have](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=319) [three type of colors on this chart you](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=321) [can see too](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=323) [the ones that are a bit more bluish](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=325) [are not breadcrumbs they are links](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=328) [referenced in this document you can turn](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=331) [this off and only see the breadcrumbs in](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=334) [this case](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=337) [or for me i like to see all of the links](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=338) [and](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=342) [the links that are that don't have a](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=343) [breadcrumb the logic will be if it is a](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=346) [backlink then it will be apparent if it](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=349) [is a link then it's going to be a child](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=352) [so let's go back to today's](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=355) [storyboard and let's just understand a](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=359) [bit more about this setup as i've](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=362) [mentioned already the brain navigation](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=365) [is a form of organizing and navigating](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=368) [your hierarchy in your graph](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=371) [i'm using breadcrumbs to visualize my](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=374) [vault and breadcrumbs recognizes](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=377) [directions](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=380) [indeed you need to set up hierarchies in](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=382) [breadcrumb settings so if you come here](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=385) [to breadcrumbs](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=387) [you can open up the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=389) [hierarchies settings and you can see](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=391) [that this is](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=393) [the hierarchy that i've set up i have](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=394) [various upward relations parents](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=397) [yesterday and this week i have siblings](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=400) [that](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=403) [i actually don't specifically highlight](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=404) [you can also](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=407) [specify here](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=409) [that same parent](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=410) [is siblings so if i share a parent then](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=412) [that is considered the sibling i turned](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=416) [this on](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=418) [and then i have children and tomorrow](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=420) [are the downward relationships and the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=422) [lateral](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=425) [relationship are jump and previous](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=426) [but i'm only using the jumps and also in](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=430) [the brain interface i'm not showing the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=434) [two directions i'm only showing jumps](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=436) [and previous together on the left hand](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=438) [side](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=441) [now](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=443) [you can say troubleshooting but things](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=445) [to keep in mind so when you're using](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=447) [breadcrumbs you will probably need to](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=450) [initialize the index before you start to](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=453) [use the brain user interface and you can](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=456) [do this by opening the matrix view](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=459) [of breadcrumbs and clicking on refresh](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=463) [index](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=466) [and once you've done that and you start](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=468) [the brain interface i'll show you in a](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=470) [second how to do that](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=472) [then the whole setup is going to work](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=474) [breadcrumbs is a bit complex i do](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=477) [recommend reading about the settings and](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=480) [the logic but once you get the hang of](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=484) [it it is a very well developed plugin](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=486) [and i'm pretty sure you're going to](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=489) [enjoy it](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=491) [and finally this is a limitation and i](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=492) [hope](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=495) [eventually this limitation will go away](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=496) [but breadcrumbs assumes unique file](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=499) [names that means that when you have](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=502) [files with the same name but in](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=504) [different folders](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=506) [in breadcrumbs you will not be able to](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=507) [distinguish between them so that is](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=510) [causing a bit of a problem](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=513) [i've started to rename my files so they](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=515) [are unique but also i plan to work with](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=518) [the developer of breadcrumbs to sort](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=521) [this out and have an option to use](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=524) [unique file names as defined by the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=527) [complete file path](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=530) [as mentioned this whole setup is](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=534) [inspired by the brain and i highly](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=536) [recommend that you try out the brain if](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=539) [you like this sort of graph interface](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=541) [and once again this is the logic of how](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=546) [the nodes appear on the graph view you](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=549) [have the central node](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=551) [in the center you have the children](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=553) [below the parents above the jumps on the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=555) [left hand side and the siblings on the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=558) [right hand side in the graph view](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=560) [and this script is available in the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=564) [xcalitro script engine store](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=567) [and what you need to pay attention to is](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=571) [the script will overwrite the active](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=574) [drawing so the way you start the script](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=577) [and let me show you how you would start](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=579) [in a blank setting](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=582) [you open a new document you click on the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=584) [obsidian icon and you click the icon of](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=588) [the brain interface which is this icon](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=592) [for you it's going to show under](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=595) [downloaded scripts and not under user](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=597) [scripts it's in user scripts because i'm](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=599) [now using a local copy of this file](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=602) [because i'm still editing it but when i](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=606) [click this](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=608) [then](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=609) [first a message came up that was a very](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=610) [short-lived message](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=613) [telling me that i should open a document](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=614) [on the left hand side and that was](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=617) [already done and it also reminded me](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=618) [that i should](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=621) [refresh the breadcrumbs index and from](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=622) [here on this is going to work you click](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=626) [the items and the documents open up or](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=630) [you click the documents](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=633) [and the related](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=636) [graph opens here on the right hand side](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=638) [an additional cool feature](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=642) [is if you switch from view mode](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=644) [back to](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=647) [edit mode and you click the button again](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=648) [you see this message up here](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=651) [brain graph is off](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=653) [this means that now the graph is not](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=656) [running anymore so if](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=658) [i navigate for example to this document](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=660) [this](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=664) [will stay as is](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=665) [and you can](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=667) [edit this](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=669) [to your liking because this is now an](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=670) [ex-collateral drawing with these](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=673) [documents as links so these are actually](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=677) [individual](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=681) [links right here](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=682) [so these are nice links you can see](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=686) [and you can do whatever you want](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=691) [in terms of](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=694) [changing this drawing you can change the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=695) [color of it you can](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=698) [draw on it this is](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=700) [now a normal ex-collateral drawing but](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=702) [when you turn](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=706) [the script engine on](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=707) [again or the brain](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=709) [graph you engine on again then this](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=712) [drawing is going to disappear and it](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=714) [automatically turns into](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=717) [this automatically generated graph](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=719) [if you don't like the colors i've set up](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=724) [here](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=726) [you can go to x color draw settings and](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=727) [every script can have](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=730) [settings this has quite a number of](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=733) [settings so if you scroll to the bottom](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=735) [of](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=737) [the list you will see here this is the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=737) [brain](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=741) [like interface i call it here brainplex](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=742) [but it will have a slightly different](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=745) [name in the store](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=747) [anyway you will find it and you can see](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=749) [all the different settings so for](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=752) [example i have hide attachments and](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=754) [infernon breadcrumb links](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=756) [turned on](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=759) [as well as you can change the font type](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=761) [so let's say i want hand written fonts](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=763) [and i want](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=766) [a bit rougher edges](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=768) [and i actually want](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=770) [sharp rectangles now if i](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=773) [come back and](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=776) [re-initiate](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=778) [this](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=780) [graph view again then you can see that](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=782) [the graph view has changed and now the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=785) [lines are](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=787) [not so straight they are](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=789) [a bit more sketchy and the character or](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=791) [the font type or font face](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=794) [has changed](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=797) [so finally i want to show you the source](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=801) [code as well](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=804) [not because i want to explain it to you](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=805) [just because this is the art of the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=807) [possible so this is a script engine code](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=810) [and if you're interested you can also go](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=814) [and read the code i'm pretty sure you](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=816) [will find things that you would do](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=819) [better and i'm more than happy if you](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=822) [come back with some recommendations how](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=825) [to make this code better](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=827) [and let's close](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=829) [this discussion today just showing you](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=831) [the storyboard for today so what we](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=834) [talked about was](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=836) [the brain like interface for obsidian](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=838) [and this is inspired by the brain](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=843) [this is](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=846) [a an implementation of using the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=847) [hierarchy as a navigation principle in](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=850) [your hold and](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=855) [as i mentioned earlier the more ways you](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=856) [can access your knowledge in your world](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=859) [the better you can reuse that](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=862) [information so you should](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=864) [aim to](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=866) [implement](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=867) [methods along all five of these](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=869) [categories to access your data in the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=872) [graph](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=875) [and we talked about the breadcrumbs](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=876) [and some of the limitations around it](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=879) [and we talked about](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=881) [this warning that you need to pay](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=883) [attention to](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=885) [which document you initiate this script](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=888) [on because it will overwrite that](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=891) [document however there's that additional](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=893) [feature that you can stop the script at](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=896) [any time and you can simply use the](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=898) [drawing to customize it for your own](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=902) [purposes i hope you enjoyed today's](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=905) [video thank you for watching and hope to](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=907) [see you next time thank you](https://youtu.be/J4T5KHERH_o?t=910)
