![The Visual Thinking Framework with Obsidian and Excalidraw: Making Visual Connections between Notes](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo)

# Summary
In this video, the presenter discusses their visual thinking framework and its application using Obsidian and Excalidraw, focusing on how to create visual connections between notes. The video highlights how integrating and linking ideas can enhance understanding and encourage creative thinking. It also introduces a specific script within Excalidraw that allows users to deconstruct selected elements into new drawings, demonstrating practical usage through examples.

# Key Takeaways
- The integration of images and frameworks within notes can create meaningful connections and enhance the learning process.
- Using Excalidraw in conjunction with Obsidian allows for the visualization of complex ideas and the organization of thoughts effectively.
- The "deconstruct selected elements into a new drawing" script is a useful tool for creating distinct visual notes while maintaining links to the original content.

# Content
Hey everyone, yesterday I had the distinct pleasure of presenting at Nick Milo's Linking Your Thinking conference about my visual thinking framework. There was one thing I didn't have time to show you, and that goes to the heart of my visual thinking framework and why I think what I'm doing with Obsidian and Excalidraw is super interesting. So, I wanted to do this quick video to walk you through a use case that I wanted to show you but we didn't have time. [* ](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=0)

Let's first look at my notes. What you see on screen are the notes I took during Nick's keynote presentation, and he was talking about the ACE framework. As Nick was talking about the ACE framework, it reminded me of something similar, and that something similar was the CODE framework, which stands for Capture, Organize, Distill, and Express. This is, of course, from Thiago Forte's "Building a Second Brain," and I embedded this image here from my book on a page summary for Thiago's book. Because I embedded this image on a page summary for "How to Take Smart Notes," this created a link between the two notes. [* ](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=35)

Let me show you how this works. I'm going to open Excalidraw by opening the command palette, searching for "brain," and opening it in a pop-out window. So now, if I look at this view of this note in the brain, you can see that in the center, I have the ACE framework. On the left-hand side, I have the CODE framework as an image. If I click on the CODE framework, I'm going to navigate to it, and you can see here that I have the CODE framework right here. This image is a child of my book on a page for the "Building a Second Brain" summary. If I click on here, then this will open the "Building a Second Brain" book on a page, and you will see that right in the center, you have the CODE framework. By embedding this into my notes about the keynote by Nick, I immediately made a connection between Nick's keynote or my notes about Nick's keynote and my book on a page summary about Thiago's book. [* ](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=90)

I want to show you how I did this because I think the process is pretty neat. There was another interesting conversation, and I'm going to switch to my demo vault so I can demonstrate how this works. The other presentation was by Vicky Zhao, and she talked about visual MOCs. This is my summary of her presentation. In the presentation, she led the team through a conversation about holding opposing ideas in our mind at the same time and creating a visual MOC about this topic. In that conversation, this quote was suggested by someone, or maybe by Vicky herself, that according to Albert Rothenberg, the construction of oppositions is the most reliable way of generating new ideas. I remember that I heard this quote before, so what I did is I copied this part from the quote, just this central part, and I went over to my search in Obsidian, typed in this quote, and behold, yes, I did remember correctly; in "How to Take Smart Notes" by Ahrens, this quote was mentioned. I highlighted it to myself. Actually, I did more than just highlight the note; I added the note to my book on a page summary. So here in the center, you can see that I have Albert Rothenberg's quote. Now, what I would like to do is move this entire part of my permanent note into my meeting notes about Vicky's presentation so that the links remain. [* ](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=140)

So, when I have this document or this image in Vicky's note, similarly to how I showed you with the CODE framework next to ACE in Nick's keynote presentation, I also create a link. How do I do this? I have a very nice tool, and I'm going to include in the video description the name of the script that I'm going to be using. The name of the script is "Deconstruct Selected Elements into a New Drawing," and you can find this tool if you open the Obsidian menu in Excalidraw. Right here in the top left, you can click on the script library, and in the script library, you can scroll down to "Deconstruct Selected Elements into a New Drawing." You can click on that and install this script; it's that easy. [* ](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=181)

But right now, I already have the script here. The way you can add it to the right-hand side panel is by long-clicking on the icon. So now I'm going to long-click; that's going to remove the icon from here, so you can see it is now removed. I also get the message here at the bottom. Then, if I again long-click on this, then the icon is added to my side panel for easy access. This is a tool I use regularly, so I think it is really good to place it on the right panel, at least for me. [* ](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=360)

So, what I want to show you now is I'm going to select this text, and I'm going to click the "Deconstruct Selected Elements into a New Drawing" button. When I do this, the script asks for a name for the new drawing, so I'm going to call it "Construction of Oppositions." This is going to be the name of my new drawing, and I'm just going to click "OK." So what happens? You can see on the right-hand side, this new drawing was created, and on the left-hand side, this is no longer separate elements, but it's this image right here. I can also prove it to you if you would not believe me. If I put this circle here and then click back, it will refresh, and the circle will appear. With this, I created a separate note that only includes this, but I still have the image in the original drawing. [* ](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=402)

Now, if I go back to my note with Vicky, I can simply click here on the visual MOC note, and what I can do is press Command + P and type "Insert Image or Excalidraw Drawing from Your Vault." I click on this, and I'm going to type "Construction of Oppositions." So here's my drawing, and when I click "OK," then voila, I have the drawing right here. Of course, I can zoom in, and now I can delete the text; I no longer need this. I'm just going to place this right here, and now I have reference not only to Albert Rothenberg's quote but also to the double bubble map, which is an excellent way to compare oppositions. That is a subject for another video. I'm going to include a link to my discussion about the eight thinking maps and the double bubble map if you want to explore that further. [* ](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=480)

But what I want to show you now is going back to my main vault here. You can see that this is my note about Vicky's presentation. I have this quote from Albert Rothenberg here, and if I look now at my map, then I'm going to find here the actual drawing, so "Construction of Oppositions" is the most... etc. If I click on it, that will bring up this note, and here I already see that this image, this atomic visual idea, is used in two different places. It's used in my book on a page for "How to Take Smart Notes," so right here, the one that you also saw earlier, and you can see my note right there, as well as you can see it in Vicky's note. So if I come back here to Vicky's note, you can see the item here as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=542)

This is a pattern that I regularly do with all my notes. Whenever I'm thinking about something in a visual way, I think about references that I have in my notes, and I use the "Deconstruct Selected Elements" script to carve out parts of the note that I want to reuse. With this, I'm able to create links between my notes that makes my Obsidian world and my visual thinking notes super connected and super engaging. By reusing images or parts of images, I can create connections in my thinking. So, I hope you found this quick summary helpful. [* ](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=610)

If you want to learn more, I want to remind you that the registrations for cohort four of the visual thinking workshop are open. The cohort will start at the end of May and extend until the very beginning of July. We're going to be exploring "Deconstructing Greatness" by Ron Friedman. This time around, I'm announcing the book that we are going to be processing, and it's going to be six intensive weeks of reading the book and processing it into a visual summary, as well as creating visual permanent notes. We're going to be exploring many other tools and techniques and different parts of the framework that I've just shown you. If you're interested, please check out the link to the workshop site, and you can read all about the registration and content of the workshop, as well as I'm sharing lots of examples and useful links to videos that you might want to explore as well. Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=738)

I had the honor of presenting at the @linkingyourthinking conference yesterday. As I took notes on the other awesome presentations during the conference I noticed there is a visual linking pattern I repeatedly use. I wanted to quickly capture this in a video so you can all benefit from this approach.

In this video, I explain how I use Obsidian Excalidraw and the “Deconstruct selected elements into a new drawing” script to carve-out parts of an existing drawing and use this image to link my notes and create a visual thinking framework. I show how I connect my notes from Nick Milo’s keynote presentation on the ACE framework and Thiago Forte’s Code framework using Obsidian Excalidraw.

to](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=190) [you how this works so the other](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=193) [presentation was by Vicky Zao and she](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=195) [talked about Visual mlcs and this is my](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=198) [summary of her presentation](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=202) [in the presentations she led the team](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=205) [through a conversation about holding](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=208) [opposing ideas in our mind at the same](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=211) [time and creating a visual Moc about](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=214) [this topic and in that conversation this](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=218) [quote was suggested by someone or maybe](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=222) [by Vicky herself that according to](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=225) [Albert Rosenberg the construction of](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=229) [oppositions is the most reliable way of](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=233) [generating new ideas and I remember that](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=236) [I heard this quote before so what I did](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=239) [is I copied this part from the quote](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=243) [just this central part and I went over](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=247) [to my search in obsidian and I typed in](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=251) [this quote to search and behold yes I](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=256) [did remember correctly in how to take](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=261) [smart notes by irons this quote was](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=264) [mentioned and I highlighted it to myself](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=267) [actually I did more than just](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=269) [highlighting the note](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=271) [I actually added the note to my book on](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=273) [a page summary so here in the center you](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=277) [can see that I have Albert rosenberg's](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=281) [quote now what I would like to do is I](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=285) [would like to move this entire part of](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=288) [my permanent note this part I would like](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=291) [to move into my meeting notes about](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=294) [Vicky's presentation such that the links](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=298) [remain](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=302) [so when I have this document or this](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=303) [image in Vicky's note](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=306) [similarly to how I showed you with the](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=308) [code framework next to Ace in Nick's](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=312) [keynote presentation I also create a](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=315) [link](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=317) [so how do I do this](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=319) [I have a](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=321) [very nice tool and I'm going to include](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=322) [in the video description the name of the](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=325) [script that I'm going to be using the](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=328) [name of the script is deconstruct](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=331) [selected elements into a new drawing and](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=333) [you can find this tool if you open the](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=337) [obsidian menu in excalator and right](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=340) [here in the top left you can click on](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=343) [the script library and in the script](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=346) [Library you can just simply scroll down](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=349) [to the construct selected elements into](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=351) [a new drawing you can click on that and](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=354) [you can install this script it's that](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=357) [easy](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=360) [but right now](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=361) [um I already have the script here the](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=363) [way you can add it to the right hand](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=365) [side panel right here is by long](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=368) [clicking on the icon so now I'm going to](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=370) [Long click that's going to remove the](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=373) [icon from here so you can see it was now](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=375) [removed and I also get the message here](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=378) [at the bottom and then if I again along](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=380) [click on this then the icon is added to](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=384) [my site panel for easy access and this](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=387) [is a tool I use regularly so I think it](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=390) [is really good to place it on the right](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=394) [panel at least for me](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=397) [so what I want to show you is now I'm](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=399) [going to select this text and I'm going](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=402) [to click the deconstruct selected](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=407) [elements into a new drawing button and](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=411) [when I do this the script asks for a](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=414) [name for the new drawing so I'm going to](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=417) [call it construction of](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=420) [oppositions](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=424) [this is going to be the name of my new](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=426) [drawing and I'm just going to click ok](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=428) [so what happens you can see on the right](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=431) [hand side this new drawing was created](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=433) [and on the left hand side this is no](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=437) [longer separate elements but it's this](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=440) [image right here I can also prove it to](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=443) [you if you would not believe me so if I](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=446) [put this circle here then if I click](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=448) [back it will refresh and the circle will](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=451) [appear so with this I created a separate](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=455) [note that only includes this but in the](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=459) [original drawing I still have the image](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=461) [in there and now](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=464) [if I go back to my note with Wiki I can](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=467) [just simply click here on the visual Moc](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=472) [note and what I can do is simply press](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=475) [command p and I'm going to type insert](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=479) [image or Excalibur drawing from your](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=483) [Vault I click on this and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=487) [type can](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=490) [destruction of opposition so here's my](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=491) [drawing and when I click ok then voila I](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=496) [have the drawing right here and of](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=502) [course I can zoom in and now I can](https://youtu.be/mvMQcz401yo?t=506) [delete this
