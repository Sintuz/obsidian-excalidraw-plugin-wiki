![Excalidraw-Obsidian 2.2.10: Image Fragments](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt introduces a new feature for Excalidraw that enhances the way users can work with image fragments and block references. He demonstrates how to copy links to selected elements, either as a frame or as clipped frames, making it easier to reference specific parts of images in Markdown documents. The video also compares image fragments with construction techniques in visual thinking, highlighting their uses and differences.

# Key Takeaways
- A new feature in Excalidraw allows users to copy links for selected elements, enhancing how image fragments are used in Markdown documents.
- Users can now choose between full frame references and clipped frame references, providing more options for how images are integrated into their notes.
- The differences between image fragments and construction techniques are explained, emphasizing when to use each to optimize visual thinking in Obsidian.

# Content
Hey everyone, it's Zsolt here. I have a special feature for you, one which many of you have asked for many times, and I finally decided to build it. This feature builds on block references for images but now takes it a step further. Let's start this demonstration with something that should already be familiar. Imagine I have this drawing and I have this group of elements here. So, this is grouped into an Excal group. If I right-click on the group, I can select "Copy link for selected elements," and I get this dialogue where I can either copy a link, an area, or a group reference. I'm not going to go deep into what area and group are; there's another video linked in the description that you can watch for that. I'm now going to click on "group" and if I head over to a Markdown document and paste this, then this part of that larger image is pasted here. If I long-click on this, then my original image opens and it's zoomed on the element. This is super useful. Now, the new feature allows you to do exactly the same via Excalidraw. So now, if I head over here and just simply press Ctrl + V, or I can also just simply paste, then this part of the image from the other image was inserted here. I think this is as you would expect how it works. [* ](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=0)

Now, I want to show you two more interesting things here. First of all, if I take this house or this frame—this is using the frame tool—if I right-click on the frame and copy the link for selected elements, then now you can see that I have two new buttons. I have "frame" and "clipped frame." So, let's first copy the frame. If I copy the frame and head over here, then you will see that everything in the frame was copied here. So if I come back here, you will see that actually this cart didn't fit the frame, but these elements were contained in the frame. In the case of a frame reference, all the elements from the frame are referenced without the clipping. This was available until now but only for Markdown documents. So, imagine I can come over here and of course, in the Markdown document as well, I can paste this frame reference. What's new is now I also have the clipped frame reference. If I click this and come over here, then you can see that now the cart is inserted with the clipping of the frame also. It's maybe not so noticeable, but I think you can see this—that here you can see there's a padding. This is the default padding that was set up in your settings; if it's a clipped frame, then the padding is going to be zero. It's going to be right on the frame. So, this is the clipped frame reference, and of course, the same works for a Markdown document as well. I can insert a clipped frame here as well, but in this case, the entire frame is included, so you can also notice that the empty space above the cart is included here because this is the frame window, while in this case, it's the elements within the frame with the frame reference. [* ](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=45)

And then the final piece I want to show you is, notice how this frame is called a cart and this frame is called a house. Now, first of all, notice that my reference here includes a long ID; this is the ID of the element. But if I now change this to "house," then, of course, this frame reference will now reference the house frame. Similarly, here, if I change this so this is my CLI frame, change this to "house," then you will see that it's the clipped house, so that's the entire house with all the elements. And this is just the clipped house. You can notice that in this case, my reference says "clipped frame." The same works in the case of the inserted images here. So, here you cannot change the reference in Excalidraw; you need to switch over to Markdown view mode, flip the page, and here, if you open Excalidraw data and come down to embedded files, then I can change this reference here to "house" if I want to see what I'm doing. I can also put the exclamation mark here, so I can see what I'm doing. I'm going to change this one to "house" as well, and now if I flip back, then you will see that these images were now replaced with the frame references of the house. This allows you maybe even from script to select which part of an image you want to insert here. [* ](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=100)

And then the final feature I want to show you, which is just a small bonus feature, is if I have no elements selected, I just simply click on the back of the image. Then I now have this new function here: "Copy embed link for this drawing." This is super useful because if I click this, I can, for example, come over here and press paste, and with that, I've inserted that drawing. This is just a very quick reference. I can do the same here. So, if I now copy the link for this drawing and head over here, then you can see that I was able to very quickly paste this image right here. I think this just makes it so much more convenient and easy. Also, if you want, this is available—this command is "Copy link for selected elements," but also "Copy link for this drawing" is available on the command palette, so you can use Obsidian hotkeys if you want to set something up. [* ](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=175)

Now that we've looked at the feature, let's quickly look at how the construction and image fragments are similar and different. I'm going to be using the double bubble map, one of my favorite visual thinking tools, to do this. I'll include a link in the video description to my video about the double bubble map. But let's jump in and first look at the similarities. Both the construction and image fragments help you break down complex visuals into more manageable components. They allow you to isolate parts of a larger drawing and enhance your focus on specific elements within that larger context, and they allow you to link and reuse visual elements in different drawings. But then, there are some differences, and I made these into pairs. So, on one hand side, deconstruction creates reusable icons for repeated use, typically icons that you want to repeat many times. On the other hand, image fragments create a part or reference a specific part of a larger illustration. This is, for example, perfect for an infographic type of setup where you have a big image and then you take parts and break the image up and provide some explanation around it. [* ](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=240)

Now, in the case of the construction, the carved-out element becomes context neutral. Once you've deconstructed it, you can use it many places and it will be neutral to the context. On the other hand, image fragments retain the context of the fragment's source. So, the original image, of course, is always referenced, and then you're referencing that part of the image. The construction is suitable for frequent reuse across multiple contexts, as I mentioned earlier. On the other hand, image fragments are ideal for infrequent and specific references. Based on this line of logic, the construction is efficient; it only will render or Excalidraw; the plugin will only need to render those isolated elements, while in the case of image fragments, the entire image is rendered, and then the part is isolated. Now, in my mind, the construction is more robust because you have a dedicated file for your carved-out element. In the case of an image fragment, it's fragile because imagine you have a group of elements and you forget about the link. Then you ungroup the elements and regroup them, and with that, the group ID is going to change, which means that your link is going to break. You're not even going to notice it until several months later when you open the other document and realize that, oops, I don't even know what that reference was meant to do. [* ](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=340)

Now, the construction approach benefits from having an icon library and a naming convention, and I'm going to include my link to the icon library video in the description. On the other hand, image fragments—your library is actually the source image itself, so you will need to open the source image and reference the elements there. Finally, the construction allows you to further construct elements into smaller parts. So, imagine you have a picture, you deconstructed the house, and then in the next step, you can deconstruct the window from the house and so on. So, as a comparison, I think these thoughts hopefully help you decide when to use image fragments and when to use the construction. With that, that is all I wanted to share with you today. If you're interested in learning more about my visual thinking workflows, about Excalidraw, and becoming a real power user—not only of Excalidraw but also of visual thinking in Obsidian—I recommend that you check out cohort 10 of the visual thinking workshop, which will commence at the end of August. Thank you! [* ](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=420)

that everything in the frame was](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=133) [copied here so if I come back here you](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=137) [will see that actually this cart didn't](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=139) [fit the frame but it was these elements](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=143) [were contained in the frame so in case](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=146) [of a frame frame reference the entire](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=149) [all the elements from the frame are](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=153) [referenc without the clipping and this](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=155) [is why and this was available until now](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=158) [but only two markdown documents so](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=160) [imagine I can come over here and of](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=163) [course in the markdown document as well](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=166) [I can paste this frame reference what's](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=168) [new is now I also have the clipped frame](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=172) [reference if I click this and come over](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=177) [over here then you can see that now the](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=179) [cart is inserted with the clipping of](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=183) [the frame also it's maybe not so](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=187) [noticeable but I think you can see this](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=190) [that here you can see there's a padding](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=193) [so this is the default padding that was](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=195) [set up in your settings if it's a](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=198) [clipped frame then the padding is going](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=200) [to be zero so it's going to be right on](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=203) [the frame but so this is the clipped](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=205) [frame reference and of course the same](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=209) [works for a markdown document as well so](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=212) [I can insert a clipped frame here as](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=215) [well but in this case the entire frame](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=219) [is included so you can also notice that](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=222) [the empty space above the cart is](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=225) [included here because this is The Frame](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=229) [Window while in this case it's the](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=232) [elements within the frame with the frame](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=235) [reference and then the final piece I](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=238) [want to show you is notice how this](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=241) [Frame is called a cart and this Frame is](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=243) [called a house now first of all](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=247) [notice that my reference here](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=249) [includes a long ID so this is the ID of](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=253) [the element but if I now change this to](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=258) [house then of course this frame](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=261) [reference will now reference the house](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=265) [frame and S similarly here if I change](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=268) [this so this is my CLI frame change this](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=271) [to house then you will see that here](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=275) [it's the clipped house so that's the](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=278) [entire house with all the elements and](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=280) [this is just the clipped house and you](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=282) [can notice that in this case my](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=285) [reference says clipped](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=287) [frame the same Works in case of the](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=289) [inserted images here so here you cannot](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=293) [change the reference in EXC colal you](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=295) [need to change change over to markdown](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=299) [View mode you need to flip the page and](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=301) [here if you open exol dra data and you](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=304) [come down to embedded files then I can](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=307) [change this reference here to house if I](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=310) [want to see what I'm doing I can also](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=314) [put the exclamation mark here so I can](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=316) [see what I'm doing I'm going to change](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=319) [this one to house as well and now if I](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=322) [flip back then you will see that these](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=327) [images were now replaced with the frame](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=330) [references of the house this allows you](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=332) [maybe even from script to select which](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=336) [part of an image you want to insert here](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=339) [and then the final feature I want to](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=343) [show you which is just a small bonus](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=346) [feature is if I have no elements](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=348) [selected I just simply click on the back](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=352) [of the image then I now have this new](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=355) [function here copy embed link for this](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=359) [drawing this is super useful because if](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=363) [I click this I can for example come over](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=365) [here and press paste and with that I've](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=368) [inserted that drawing so this is just a](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=372) [very quick reference I can do the same](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=375) [here so if I now copy edling for this](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=377) [drawing and head over here then you can](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=380) [see that I was able to very quickly](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=382) [paste this image right here I think this](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=387) [just makes it so much more convenient](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=390) [and easy and also if you want this is](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=393) [available this command a copy link for](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=396) [copy link for selected elements but also](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=400) [copy link for this drawing is available](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=402) [on the command palette so you can use](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=404) [obsidian hot keys if you want to set](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=407) [something up now that we've looked at](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=409) [the feature let's quickly look at how](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=412) [the construction and image fragments are](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=414) [similar and different I'm going to be](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=417) [using the double bubble map one of my](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=419) [favorite visual Thinking Tools to do](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=422) [this I'll include a link in the video](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=424) [description to my video about the double](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=427) [bubble map but let's jump in and first](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=429) [look at the similarities so both the](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=432) [construction and image fragments helps](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=435) [you break down complex visuals into more](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=438) [manageable](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=441) [components they allow you to isolate](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=443) [parts of a larger drawing and thus](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=446) [enhance hands focus on specific elements](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=449) [within that larger context and they](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=452) [allow you to link and reuse visual](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=455) [elements in different](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=458) [drawings but then there are some](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=460) [differences and I made these into pairs](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=462) [so on one hand side](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=466) [deconstruction creates reusable icons](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=469) [for repeated use typically icons that](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=472) [you want to repeat many times on the](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=475) [other hand](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=478) [image](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=479) [fragments](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=480) [create a part or reference a specific](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=483) [part of a larger illustration this is](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=486) [for example perfect for an infographics](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=489) [type of setup where you have a big image](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=491) [and then you take parts and you break](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=495) [the image up and you provide some](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=497) [explanation around it now in case of the](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=500) [construction the carved out element](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=504) [becomes context neutral so once you've](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=506) [deconstructed it you can use it many](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=510) [places and it will be neutral to the](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=513) [context on the other hand image fragment](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=516) [retains the context of the fragment](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=520) [source so the original image of course](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=523) [the larger image is always reference](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=526) [then you're referencing that part of the](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=529) [image the construction is suitable for](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=532) [frequent reuse around across multiple](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=535) [contexts as I mentioned earlier on the](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=538) [other hand image fragments are ideal for](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=541) [infrequent and specific](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=546) [references and based on or along this](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=549) [line of logic the construction is](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=552) [efficient it](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=555) [only will render or EXC colal the plugin](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=557) [will only need to render those isolated](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=560) [elements while in case of image](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=564) [fragments the entire image is random and](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=566) [then the part is](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=570) [isolated now in my mind the construction](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=572) [is more robust because you have a](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=577) [dedicated file for your carved out](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=580) [element in case of an image fragment](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=584) [it's fragile because imagine you have a](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=588) [group of elements and you forget about](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=591) [the link and then you ungroup the](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=594) [elements and regroup them and with that](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=596) [the group ID is going to change which](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=600) [means that your link is going to break](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=603) [you're not even going to notice it until](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=606) [several months later you open the other](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=608) [document and you notice that oops I](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=611) [don't even know what that reference was](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=614) [meant to do now the the construction](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=617) [approach benefits from having an icon](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=621) [library and a naming convention and I'm](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=624) [going to include my link to the](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=626) [icon library video in the description on](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=630) [the other hand image fragments your](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=634) [library is actually the source image](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=637) [itself so you will need to open the](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=640) [source image and reference the elements](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=642) [there and](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=645) [finally the construction allows you to](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=647) [further the construct elements into](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=651) [smaller parts so imagine you have a](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=653) [picture you deconstructed the house and](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=655) [then in a Next Step you can deconstruct](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=659) [the window from the house and so on so](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=662) [as a comparison I think these thoughts](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=667) [hopefully help](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=671) [you decide when to use image fragments](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=672) [and when to use the construction and](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=675) [with that that is all I wanted to share](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg?t=679)
