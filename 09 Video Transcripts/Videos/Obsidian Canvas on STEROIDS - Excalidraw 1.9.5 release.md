# Content
Hey everyone, Jolt here! I am super excited about today's video and about Excalidraw 1.9.5. This is going to blow your mind! Let me show you. The 1.9.5 release is all about frames. Let me show you first the one that's easier to demonstrate and that was added to Obsidian by the Excalidraw product team a couple of days ago. If you click here under more tools, you will see the frame tool. If you click on the frame tool, you can simply frame a number of elements, and once these elements are framed, you can move those frames together. You can do all sorts of settings on the frame; for example, you can change the opacity of the frame, or bring frames back and forth. You can also simply move items out of the frame or into the frame. Additionally, with a right-click, you can remove all elements in the frame or select all elements in the frame, or just simply delete the entire frame. I'm going to do that now. [* ](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs)

Now let's move on to the truly exciting stuff. You will notice that there's a new button here, which is the "Insert Any File from The Vault" button. If I click this, then this dialog box will open up. I can just type in the name of the document—secure enough—and this will allow me to select which section I want to open. I can click here to import it as an iframe. When I do that, an iframe is created. If I click here, then I can scroll in the document; if I click again, I can edit the document right now. Then I edit the document—scrolls to the beginning—this is a known issue. I have a promise from the Obsidian team that this is going to be resolved. Of course, you can also resize this if you want, and you can even rotate it. However, if you rotate it, you can read the document but cannot edit the document when rotated, so to rotate it back, you need to hold the Shift key and rotate it to a horizontal position. You can also do some settings if you like; you can add a stroke color maybe around this, and you can make the corners round if you want. This way, I've formatted my document, and I can put this to the side. Now, if I use the command palette and type in "any," you will see I have this action as well. So you can assign a hotkey for yourself. I will click "Insert Any File from The Vault" and look for a PDF file, "How to Read a Paragraph." I'm going to press enter. Again, you will notice that previously, as well, there were two buttons; you can also import a markdown file as an image and, also with a PDF document, you can import it as a PDF, which will have all its unique features. I'll include a link here in the video that explains how the PDF import feature works because I think that's also super, super useful. But now I'm going to show you how to import this as an iframe. So when I click here to import it as an iframe, it will be very similar. [* ](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs)

Now I think the fun stuff starts here. Let me again bring up the "Insert Any File from The Vault" dialog and let's look at our demo Kanban board. You can also import an Obsidian Kanban board, and I'm going to import this as an iframe. This time, I'm going to make this just slightly bigger. I'm going to maybe move it down to here. The nice thing is that this Kanban board is actually fully functional. If I click here, I can move maybe this card to here, and I can move this card to here. With this, I'm able to edit my Kanban board on the fly here within Obsidian. Similarly, I can show you that from your Vault, you can import other files. I didn't try that many things, but I tried MP4s, so I don't have many videos in my demo vault; this is from an old blog post. But again, if I import this as an iframe, you will see it is not perfect; the size of the frame is not perfect. But I can click here and start playing; now, this video is playing in the background. Again, I can set the border color to whatever I want and also change it if I want. This is now here and nice. The background color or the theme of the documents that you import will depend on your Excalidraw theme. Right now, I'm using Excalidraw in light mode. If I switch to dark mode, you will see that all of the documents and everything will switch to the dark theme as well. You can control this; if regardless of the theme of the document, you would rather follow the theme of Obsidian, there is a setting in the Excalidraw plugin settings under display. Here, under display, you can change that iframes should match the Obsidian theme. If I turn this off and come back, then everything will be dark, but the background will be light because this is my Excalidraw theme. You can also override this on a file level. You need to open the document in markdown mode and can add a formatter key to control how the frames are displayed. In this case, I'm going to open the drawing as a markdown document, and here in the front matter, I'm going to type "X Excalidraw iframe." You can see there are four values you can set. This can be dark, light, auto, and default. Default means it follows your Obsidian theme. Auto is automatically adjusted to the Excalidraw theme, and if I set this to light as fixed, then I'm going to set this to light, regardless of my plugin settings; the frames are going to be loaded with light themes. [* ](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs)

So now let's look at also drag-and-drop because drag-and-drop also works. I'm going to just take this document right here and drop it here. But before I drop it, notice the tooltip; there it says "Insert Link," and try Shift-Control-Alt combinations to find out the drop actions. On Windows, you need to press Ctrl+Shift to insert something as an iframe. So now I'm holding the mouse button, dragging this file, and as I'm dragging it, then I'm over the Excalidraw area where I want to drop it. I press Ctrl+Shift and let go of the mouse button, and then my document is imported like this. Now I can also show you the key combinations; you will find this table in the Excalidraw readme. I'll show you in just one second where that is. Here you can see that there are two new key combinations. The first combination is when you're dragging and dropping a file from within Obsidian. On Windows, it's Ctrl+Shift, and on a Mac, it's the Control button; it will drop it as an iframe. When we drop this from the internet, then it's Ctrl+Shift on both Mac and Windows. I'll show you just a second how that works. As I promised, this table is available in the Excalidraw readme. You will find the Excalidraw readme if you open settings, go to community plugins, search for Excalidraw, and click on Excalidraw; this will open the readme, and if you scroll down in the readme, you will find this table right here. So anytime you need to get back to this, you will find it here. [* ](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs)

Getting back to our story, I'm going to minimize this. Let's look at some of the web drag-and-drops. Let's start with this example: I have a YouTube video that I want to bring in. I'm going to grab the YouTube video and just move it over to Excalidraw. I'm going to press Ctrl+Shift to drop it in here, and with that, the video is in. Of course, as you would expect, if you click the center, it's going to start playing, and you can see it has a thick border which means the video is active. You can now move the video. If I click anywhere else, then the video is playing, but it's no longer active. So you can resize it if you want or do any other transformations; maybe you can rotate this as well. If you click the center again, it will stop and, if you click it again, then it will continue. I think this is pretty useful when you're taking notes on a video in Excalidraw, and you just want to start and stop the video. Now moving on from a video, let me show you how this works with a Twitter tweet. For example, I want to bring this tweet into my document; I can click here to share the tweet. I can copy the link to the tweet, and I can come here and simply paste the tweet. When I paste the tweet, I select it, paste, and then the tweet was imported, and I can interact with the tweet. I can also again enlarge the tweet if I want to, so this becomes another interactive document. Also, I can bring in web pages. Let me just show you another way to do this. Now this is going to be the Obsidian web page, so I can just simply drag the web page, Ctrl+Shift, and drop it in here, and now I have the Obsidian web page. I think it's a cool feature, and it's sort of the consequence of being able to embed, and this will only work in Obsidian desktop; this way, in Obsidian mobile, I think the full feature will not be available. But let me show you what I mean. You can also use applications that need an identity. This is my ChatGPT account, and what I want to show you is a new feature in ChatGPT: you can share a chat. I'm going to copy the link to this chat, and once I've copied the link to the chat, I'm going to now use the web embed feature. I could just simply paste the link here as I did in the other cases. I just want to show you another way of creating a frame. So I can click here on "Web Embed." I can create an empty embed form, and I’m just going to simply paste the link here that I picked up from ChatGPT. When I press enter, then this dialog is imported. You can see here that this is my discussion of ChatGPT, and if I click here to continue the conversation, then I can actually continue my conversation. Imagine the use case that you're doing some research; you insert your ChatGPT conversation here, do a mind map around it, and whenever you have additional questions, you can just continue that conversation, and that conversation is going to be saved here in your drawing. [* ](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs)

Another example, and this is just for fun, but there's also a cool additional feature that I'll talk about in a next video, is if I create another web frame. Now I'm going to just simply type "excalidraw.com," then you will see here this is now a web instance of Excalidraw that was imported. If I click here, then this instance is going to work just as your normal web instance of Excalidraw. You can actually have an embedded Excalidraw drawing. However, I want to point out that right now this is deliberately not supported. If I click to add a document and choose maybe an Excalidraw drawing, you'll see that this is an Excalidraw drawing that I can only import as an image. This is now imported as an image; I will eventually come to a point where you can embed an Excalidraw drawing in a similar way within Obsidian. Right now, there are some minor issues, and I decided for now I would rather release this set of features to you instead of trying to work out all the nitty-gritty details of every single piece of functionality. So when you have everything here or you've moved your items in, of course, everything that works in Excalidraw still works here. I can connect these items with one another, maybe like this. I can add a curved line; I can add a relationship. Now, this text is a bit small, and I probably mistyped a relationship, but anyway, you can see that you can connect items. You can also add various components around these. So I can add this box, for example, here, and I can also simply add additional text and so on. Now, of course, the spelling is not great as I'm just trying to do all of this here on the fly, but you get the idea. You have a fully featured, let's call it, raw canvas plus all of these embedded active elements. [* ](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs)

Now, there is a bit of a special feature of these frames. A special feature is that I have additional text that is covered by this frame. Even if I bring additional text to the front, the frames are always going to be on the top. So that is currently a limitation. Also, if I embed this whole thing into a document, let me just create a new empty document right here, and let me just drag this in here and embed it like this, you will see that everything is embedded with—let me just make this larger. I'm going to make this big like this, so you will see that all of these items were imported, but we only have placeholders for most of the things. This is going to stay as is for some of the items, like the docs, for example. I hope to be able to add a preview later on, but again, this is something on the roadmap; it does not work for now. [* ](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs)

So that's all I wanted to share with you today. I hope you're as excited about all of this as I am. I think this is really mind-blowing and opens so many opportunities for Excalidraw and Obsidian. This is a minimum viable product release. I think it works stably and does the job, but there are a number of rough edges; some things don't always work as intended. So I ask for your patience. If you find something, check GitHub; if no one has reported it, please report it. I'll try to refine this solution over the next couple of weeks, but I thought that I've been working on this for the better part of the last month, and instead of continuing to work in the background on this, I would release it, let you use it, and continue to work based on your feedback. So enjoy, and let me know how it all works out. I'd be very interested to hear the type of solutions that you can create with this. If you create a YouTube video, or if you post on Twitter, or share in Discord, or you post in the comments below, I'd love to see what you do with Excalidraw and Obsidian using these integration features. Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs)

of elements and once these](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=40) [elements are framed you can move those](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=42) [frames together and you can do all sorts](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=45) [of settings on the frame for example you](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=48) [can change the opacity of the frame or](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=51) [you can bring frames back and forth you](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=54) [can also simply move items out of the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=58) [frame](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=60) [or into the frame as well as with the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=61) [right click you can remove all elements](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=65) [in the frame or select all elements in](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=68) [the frame or just simply delete the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=71) [entire frame I'm going to do that now](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=74) [so now let's move on to the truly](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=78) [exciting stuff you will notice that](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=80) [there's a new button here this is the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=83) [insert any file from The Vault button if](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=85) [I click this then this dialog box will](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=87) [open

no](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=96) [one and I can click here to import it as](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=99) [an iframe and when I do that then an](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=102) [iframe is created if I click here then I](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=105) [can scroll in the document and if I](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=110) [click again then I can edit the document](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=114) [right now then I edit](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=116) [the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=119) [document Scrolls to the beginning this](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=121) [is a known issue I'm](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=124) [have a promise from the obsidian team](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=126) [that this is going to be resolved](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=128) [now of course you can also resize this](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=132) [if you want you can even rotate it if](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=135) [you want now if you rotate you can read](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=138) [the document but you cannot edit the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=141) [document when rotated so to rotate it](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=144) [back you need to hold the shift key and](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=147) [rotate it to a horizontal position

and](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=179) [I'm going to look for a PDF file how to](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=182) [read a paragraph I'm going to press](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=185) [enter](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=188) [again you will notice that previously as](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=189) [well there were two buttons so still you](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=192) [can also import a markdown file as an](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=195) [image and also with a PDF document you](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=199) [can import it as a PDF which will have](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=204) [all its create features I'll include a](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=207) [link here in the video that explains how](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=211) [the PDF import feature works because I](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=215) [think that's also super super super](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=218) [useful but now I'm going to show you how](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=220) [to import this as an iframe so when I](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=223) [click here to import it as an iframe](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=226) [then now it's not a big surprise it is](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=228) [going to be very similar so if I click](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=232) [here I can scroll in the document and](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=234) [this is I think a pretty good works very](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=237) [well now I think the fun stuff starts](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=242) [here so let me again bring up the insert](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=245) [any file from The Vault and let's look](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=250) [at our demo kombbomb board so you can](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=252) [also import an obsidian comb board and](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=256) [I'm going to import this as an iframe](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=259) [and this time I'm going to make this](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=262) [just slightly bigger I'm going to maybe](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=265) [move down to here and the nice thing is](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=268) [that this compound board is actually](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=273) [fully functional so if I click here I](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=275) [can move maybe this card to here I can](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=278) [move this card to here and with this I'm](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=281) [able to edit my kanban board on the Fly](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=285) [here within obsidian](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=288) [and similarly I can show you that also](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=291) [from your Vault you can import](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=294) [and the other file I didn't try that](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=297) [many things but I tried MP4s so I don't](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=300) [have many videos in My Demo Vault this](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=303) [is from an old blog post but again if I](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=307) [import this as an iframe then you will](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=310) [see it is not perfect so the size of the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=313) [frame is not perfect but I can click](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=316) [here and start playing and now this](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=320) [video is playing in the background and](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=323) [again I can just set the Border color](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=326) [to whatever I want and or the border and](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=330) [also the Border color if I want to](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=335) [change it so this is now here and nice](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=337) [now the color the background color or](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=341) [the theme of the documents that you](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=345) [import will depend on your Excalibur](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=347) [theme so right now I'm using excaled raw](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=351) [in light mode if I switch to dark mode](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=354) [then you will see that all of the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=357) [documents and everything](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=360) [was and now turned to the Dark theme](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=362) [also you can control this so if](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=365) [regardless of the theme of the document](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=368) [you would rather follow the theme of](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=371) [obsidian there is a setting in excalil](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=373) [draw plugin settings under display and](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=377) [here under display you can change this](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=381) [that iframes should match the obsidian](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=384) [theme so if I turn this off and come](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=388) [back then everything is going to be dark](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=391) [but the background is going to be light](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=394) [because this is my excalator theme](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=397) [now also you can override this on a file](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=400) [level you need to open the document in](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=404) [markdown mode and you can add a](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=408) [formatter key to control how the frames](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=410) [are displayed so this case I'm going to](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=414) [open the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=417) [drawing as a markdown document and here](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=419) [in the front matter I'm going to](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=422) [Type X colored raw iframe and you can](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=426) [see there are four values you can set](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=429) [this to dark light Auto and default](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=433) [default means it follows your obsidian](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=436) [theme Auto is automatically adjusted to](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=440) [the excalator theme and if I set this to](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=444) [light as fixed so I'm going to](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=447) [set this to light then regardless of my](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=451) [plugin settings the frames are going to](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=454) [be loaded with by light themes](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=457) [so now let's look at also drag and drop](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=461) [because drag and drop also works so I'm](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=465) [going to just take this document right](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=468) [here and I'm going to drop it here but](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=471) [before I drop it notice the tool tip](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=474) [there it says insert link and try shift](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=476) [Control Alt combinations to to find out](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=480) [the drop actions on Windows you need to](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=483) [press Ctrl shift to insert something as](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=487) [an iframe so now I'm holding the mouse](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=492) [button I'm dragging this file and as I'm](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=494) [dragging it then I'm over the excalator](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=497) [area where I want to drop it I press](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=501) [Ctrl shift and I let go the mouse button](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=504) [and then my document is imported like](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=507) [this now I can also show you the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=511) [key combination so there are you will](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=515) [find this table in the X call it role](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=518) [readme I'll show you in just one second](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=521) [there that is but here you can see that](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=523) [there are two new key combinations so](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=526) [combination number one](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=529) [is when you're](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=531) [dragging and dropping a file from within](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=533) [obsidian and here I just showed you that](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=537) [on Windows it's Ctrl shift on a Mac it's](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=540) [the control button and then it will drop](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=545) [it as an iframe and when we drop this](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=548) [from the internet then it's Ctrl shift](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=552) [and Ctrl shift on both Mac and windows](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=555) [I'll show you in just a second how that](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=559) [works and as I promised so this table is](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=562) [available in the X collateral readme you](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=566) [will find the X College row read me if](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=569) [you open settings you go to community](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=571) [plugins you search for X colored raw](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=574) [here and you click on X color draw](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=577) [then this will open the readme and if](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=581) [you scroll down in the readme you will](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=584) [find this table right here so anytime](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=587) [you need to get back to this you will](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=590) [find it here so getting back to our](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=593) [story I'm going to minimize this so](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=596) [let's look at some of the web drag and](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=600) [drops so let's start with this example](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=604) [that I have a YouTube video that I want](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=607) [to bring in here so I'm going to grab](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=610) [the YouTube video and I'm going to just](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=613) [uh](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=616) [move it over X color draw and then I'm](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=617) [going to press Ctrl shift to drop it in](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=620) [here and with that the video is in](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=623) [and of course as you would expect if you](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=629) [click the center it's going to start](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=632) [playing and you can see it has a](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=635) [thick border which means that the video](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=638) [is active so you can now move in the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=641) [video if I click anywhere out then the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=644) [video is no longer I mean the video is](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=648) [playing but it's no longer active so you](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=650) [can resize it if you want or](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=653) [and do any other Transformations maybe](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=656) [you can rotate this as well if you click](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=659) [the center again then it will stop and](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=662) [if you click it again then it will](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=666) [continue so this I think is pretty](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=668) [useful when you're taking notes on a](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=670) [video in X colored row and you just want](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=672) [to start and stop the video now moving](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=675) [on from a video let me show you how this](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=678) [work with a Twitter tweet so for example](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=681) [I want to bring this tweet into my](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=684) [document I can click here to share the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=688) [tweet I can copy the link to the tweet](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=691) [and I can come here and I can just](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=694) [simply paste the tweet and when I paste](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=698) [the Tweet so I select it paste then the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=701) [Tweet was imported and I can interact](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=705) [with the tweet I can also again enlarge](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=708) [the Tweet if I want to so this becomes](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=711) [here another and interactive document](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=714) [and also I can bring in web pages so let](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=718) [me just show you another way to do this](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=723) [now this is going to be the obsidian web](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=726) [page so I can just simply drag the web](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=730) [page Ctrl shift and I can drop the web](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=733) [page in here and now I have the obsidian](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=736) [web page here I think a cool feature and](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=740) [it's](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=744) [sort of the consequence of being able to](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=746) [embed and this will only work in](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=750) [obsidian desktop this way in obsidian](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=752) [mobile I think the full feature will not](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=755) [be available but let me show you what I](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=758) [mean so you can also](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=761) [use applications that need an identity](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=764) [so this is my chat GPT account and what](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=768) [I want to do or show you is a new](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=772) [feature in chai GPT is you can](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=775) [share a chat so I'm going to copy the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=779) [link to this chat](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=782) [and once I've copied the link to the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=784) [chat I'm going to now use the web embed](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=786) [feature this is I could just simply](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=790) [paste the link here as I did in the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=792) [other cases I just want to show you](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=795) [another way of creating a frame so I can](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=797) [click here on web embed I can create an](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=800) [empty embed form and I'm just going to](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=804) [Simply paste the link here that I picked](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=807) [up from chai GPT and when I press enter](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=811) [then this dialog is imported so you can](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=816) [see here that this is my discussion of a](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=820) [chai GPT and if I click here to continue](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=826) [conversation then I can actually](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=829) [continue my conversation so imagine the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=832) [use case that you're doing some research](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=835) [you insert your chain GPT conversation](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=838) [here you do a mind map around it and](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=842) [whenever you have additional questions](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=845) [you can just continue that conversation](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=847) [and that conversation is going to be](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=850) [saved here that you're drawing](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=853) [another example would be and this is I](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=856) [think just for the fun of it but there's](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=859) [also a cool additional feature that I'll](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=861) [talk about in a next video that](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=865) [you can do with this but here if I](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=868) [create another web frame and now I'm](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=871) [going to](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=874) [just simply type excalator.com then what](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=876) [you will see here is this is now a web](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=880) [instance of EX College row that was](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=884) [imported and actually if I click here](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=886) [then this instance is going to work just](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=889) [as your normal web instance of X call it](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=894) [robot so you can actually have an](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=899) [embedded x-colored raw drawing and you](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=902) [can](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=906) [also sort of embedded here now this](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=907) [brings me to a point that](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=911) [right now is deliberately not supported](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=913) [so here if I click to add a document and](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=918) [I choose maybe Boston box](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=921) [X College Raw](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=925) [this one here then this is an ex College](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=928) [roll drawing that I can only import as](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=932) [an image so this is now imported as an](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=935) [image I will eventually come to a point](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=938) [where you can embed an excluded drawing](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=941) [in a similar way within obsidian right](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=944) [now there were some minor issues and I](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=947) [decided that for now I would rather](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=950) [release this set of features to you](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=953) [instead of trying to work out all the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=956) [nitty-gritty details of every single](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=959) [piece of functionality](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=962) [so](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=966) [and then when you have everything here](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=967) [or you've moved your items in here of](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=970) [course everything that works in X](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=973) [collateral still works here so I can](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=975) [connect these items with one another](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=978) [maybe like this I can add a](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=981) [curved line I can add a relationship](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=987) [now this text is a bit small and I](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=993) [probably mistyped a relationship but](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=995) [anyway you can see that you can connect](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=999) [items you can also add various](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1002) [components around these so I can add](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1006) [this box for example here and I can also](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1009) [simply add](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1013) [additional](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1015) [text](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1020) [and so on so this now](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1021) [of course the spelling](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1026) [spelling is not great as I'm just trying](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1028) [to do all of this here on the fly but](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1031) [you get the idea so you have a full](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1034) [featured let's call it raw](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1037) [canvas](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1040) [plus all of these embedded active](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1042) [elements](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1045) [now there is a bit of](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1046) [special feature of these frames and a](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1049) [special feature is that here I have](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1053) [additional text that is covered by this](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1055) [Frame even if I bring additional text to](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1059) [the front the frames are always going to](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1064) [be on the top so that is currently a](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1067) [limitation](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1071) [also if I embed this whole thing into a](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1072) [document so let me just create a new](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1077) [empty document right here and let me](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1080) [just drag this in here and embed it](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1084) [like this you will see that everything](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1090) [is embedded with a let me just make this](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1093) [larger](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1097) [going to make this](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1099) [big like this so you will see that all](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1105) [of these items were imported but we only](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1108) [have placeholders](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1111) [for most of the things this is going to](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1113) [stay as is for some of the items like](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1117) [the dose for example I hope to be able](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1120) [to add a preview later on but again this](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1124) [is something on the roadmap does not](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1128) [work for now](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1130) [so that's all I wanted to share with you](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1134) [today I hope you're as excited about all](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1136) [of this as I am I think this is really](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1139) [mind-blowing and opens so many](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1142) [opportunities for excalator and obsidian](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1144) [this is a minimum viable product release](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1148) [I think it works stable it does the job](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1151) [but there are a number of rough edges](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1154) [some things don't always work as](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1157) [intended so I ask for your patience if](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1161) [you find something check GitHub if no](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1164) [one has reported it please report it](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1167) [I'll try to refine this solution over](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1170) [the next couple of weeks but I thought](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1173) [that I've been working on this for the](https://youtu.be/ICpoyMv6KSs?t=1175)
