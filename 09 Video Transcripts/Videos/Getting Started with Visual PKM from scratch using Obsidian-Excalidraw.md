# Content
Hey everyone, Zsolt here. I probably don't need to introduce Excalidraw and Obsidian; all of my videos are about this subject, so if you're not familiar with Excalidraw and Obsidian, I recommend watching a couple of my other videos. In today's video, I want to go back to the absolute basics. I recognize that most of my videos demonstrate advanced features of Excalidraw and show you tips and tricks on how to get complicated things done, and I don't really have many videos about the absolute basics. So, I created this curriculum. I actually was thinking about creating an Excalidraw course. I'm not sure I'm going to have the time to make it, but I thought maybe I can get started and create a couple of videos, share it, and based on the feedback, we might be able to continue this course. I laid out a course plan; you can see these brown boxes, that's the main thread of the course, and then we have some special colors here about advanced features, so those are additional things that we might be covering in this course or in a later course. Now, of course, there is no course; this is just going to be session one without the promise that there's going to be a session two. But in today's session, I want to show you how to get started with Excalidraw and Obsidian from zero to get you started. [* ](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=0)

You first of all need to install Obsidian; this one I'm not going to demonstrate. So, you can go to obsidian.md, download Obsidian; it's a free application. It works on your Android and iOS devices as well as on Linux, Windows, and macOS. It works everywhere, so you just go to obsidian.md and you get your copy or you go to the relevant app store and download it for your own device. Once you have Obsidian downloaded, you will need to create a vault, so that's what we're going to start off with here. I'm going to create a new vault, and this is just going to be my demo vault. I'm going to call this the "Excalidraw Demo Vault." When you create a new vault in Obsidian, you need to find a location for that. I keep all of my vaults on my F drive; of course, you can choose a different location for your vaults as well, but this is where I'm going to place this vault. All you need to do is select the folder here, give it a name, and click create. [* ](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=98)

Once you've created your vault, then you get this empty screen, and let's just get first familiar a little bit with Obsidian. So here on the left-hand side, you have a file explorer, and if I click here, I can create a new note, and this is going to be my first note. So Obsidian consists of so-called markdown files. Markdown is a simple markup language that helps you format documents. So first of all, this is just simply a text editor, so I can enter text; that's great. I can also create headings, so for example, this is chapter one like this, and then I can continue on with my text. So this is how Obsidian looks like now; so far, there's nothing special about this. The point where this becomes special is that it's extremely simple to link documents to one another in Obsidian. All you need to do is open double square brackets and enter the name of your file that you want to link to. So this is my— or maybe the way we're going to do this is I'm going to write "second note" here, and I'm going to just type here that this is my second note. So what you see here is a link; the color of the link is dark. You will see later on the different colors, which means that this note has not yet been created. If I click on this note, then a new file is created. You can see here on the left-hand side you have a second file created, and I can start to take notes. So this is my second note like this, and if I want, I can create additional links here. So I'm going to just link here maybe chapter 2, and I'm going to create another link here, chapter 3, like this. And of course, if I want to create chapter 2, I can click here, and this is the text for chapter two. So I think you get the idea; you can create these links, and you can also navigate by clicking on these links, and this becomes something like a set of web pages or your own Wikipedia. [* ](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=128)

Now, there's one more thing I want to show you regarding Obsidian vanilla, and then we'll jump to Excalidraw. If I modify this link here—and let me zoom in so you can see it better—if I modify this link here by adding an exclamation mark in front, then suddenly magic happens. Because instead of just having the link here, I have the contents of this page embedded here. Some people call this transclusion; you can call it embedding. The point is that by adding an exclamation mark in front of the link, you change it from a link to an embedding, and you can still open the page. So if I click here to open the link, that's going to open chapter 2, and if I write "this is my second paragraph" like this, then when I come back, I press the back arrow here, then of course you will see the second paragraph there. So I think for now that's enough about Obsidian to get you started. [* ](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=404)

The magic happens when you open settings and come to community plugins and turn on community plugins. And I say it's magic because if you click here on browse, you will see that there are over 1,100 community plugins, and this is a growing list of community plugins. You name it, we have it. This plugin store is filled with super powerful community plugins. Now we are going to install Excalidraw. The way you install, let’s call it raw, is you simply click here on Excalidraw; this happens to be currently the most downloaded plugin in Obsidian. Later on, this might change, and then you can, of course, search for Excalidraw as well. After clicking on Excalidraw, you need to click here install, and you wait a second, and you will get this message that Excalidraw was successfully installed. You still need to enable Excalidraw, and when you enable Excalidraw, you will get this message—this is a pop-up message that I use to first of all welcome you. So here there's a showcase that I recommend watching it; it will give you a taste of what Excalidraw can do, but it can do so much more than what you can see here in the showcase. And then I have updates; every now and then, I include update videos and always include a couple of bullet points explaining what I included in the update. So if you want to understand what's happening with Excalidraw, then this is a good way to understand it. Each update will come with a window like this. Right now I'm going to close this, and I'm going to close the plugin installer as well, and I'm going to close settings here as well, so for the time being we don't need that. So how do you create your very first Excalidraw drawing? Well, the absolute simplest way to create a drawing is here on the left-hand side; you see different buttons. When you install the Excalidraw plugin, you will see this new icon appear. When you click on "New Drawing," then Excalidraw opens, and this is your drawing canvas. Now, I think this is pretty self-explanatory, so I don't think I need to explain too much about it. Here on the top, you see the different tools that you can use; for example, here I can draw a rectangle, and here I can add a circle like this. [* ](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=437)

Now you can also set the properties of this. To do that, here on the left-hand side, you see this menu. So let's start with when I have an element selected—like in this case, this rectangle—then you see the painter's palette appear. If I have nothing selected, then that's not visible, and if I click on the painter's palette, then voila, all these tools, these options, these properties pop up, and I can change the settings. For example, I can add a background color, and I can also change the fill of this. So you can see here, I'm going to zoom in so you can see this, that there are different types of patterns, or you can give it a solid fill as well as you can change the width of the stroke. So here, this is the thinnest stroke, and this is the thickest stroke. So this way you can adjust the look and feel of this object. You can also change the stroke style if you want dashed or dotted lines, and you can change the sloppiness of the line. So this is the "Architect" style; the "Architect" style has precise lines and is really sharp, and then the "Cartoonist" style is this more rugged-looking. I actually love this look of Excalidraw; this is how I fell in love with the tool. I think it depends on personal preferences, of course, which one you choose. Then you can choose here to have sharp edges, which means sharp edges, or you can have round edges like this, and then, depending on the tool that you're selecting, sometimes you have different options. So for example, if I now click on an arrow and I create this arrow from the rectangle to the circle, you can see I have my arrow there. Now, if I select the arrow, then you will see that I now have an additional property pop up here, and that's the arrowhead. I can change the end of the arrow, and I can also change the beginning of the arrow, and this way, I can adjust how the arrow looks. So you can see here that I'm adjusting the arrow; the line color is always called the stroke color, and in case of an arrow, there isn't a way to fill the arrow with colors. Finally, I'm going to just add some text, so this is going to be the "Hello World" message, and I'm going to just make this bigger. Now, with the text, you have some standard sizes, so I can choose a small, medium, large, and extra large. I can also change the font family; there are only three font families by default—later, or a more advanced feature of Excalidraw in Obsidian is you can add a fourth font, but here these are the three basic font faces or font families that you can use. Now, this is a text element on its own; you can also click a rectangle and press enter, and then you're creating a sticky note. The nature of sticky notes is the text will automatically wrap, and you can see also that the sticky note becomes larger as I type. So that's a feature of sticky notes: when you're creating a sticky note, it will automatically adjust to the size of the text. If now I make my rectangle wider, then you can see how the text rearranges, and then I have my sticky note active. Then I can do a couple of additional settings, like I can text align to the left or to the right, and I can text align to the top, to the bottom, or to the middle. So these are additional options. I think as an initial introduction, this is what you would expect from a drawing tool, and I think all of these things can be done and lots of other things as well. So this is really just a very, very, very small tip of the iceberg of what you can do with Excalidraw. [* ](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=590)

Now, how do you get this drawing into your note? So now if I come back here to the second note that we created, I can simply add this drawing. There are several ways to embed this drawing. Now, I'm going to show you an Obsidian function that's super important to know about, and I'm going to show you how to embed Excalidraw. Here I'm going to press Ctrl+P; this is Command+P on a Mac. I'm going to type Excalidraw, and you can already see that there are so many options here that you can explore. All of these now, I want to search for the most recently edited drawing, and if I click here, then that drawing is embedded. Now you can do a couple of basic settings, but before we do the settings, let me just show you what you can see here. So you can observe that I have the exclamation mark here, so if I take away the exclamation mark, then this becomes a link to the drawing, and if I place the exclamation mark here, then this embeds the drawing in your note. If I want to change the size of this drawing, I can type a pipe character, and I can type a number. So maybe I want this to be 500 wide, or I might want this to be 800 wide, of course. So this is depending on your screen and your needs; you can change the width there are some other settings. For now, I think let's be happy with this. Now I want to show you another way how you can embed a drawing here, and that other way is going to involve, again, the command palette. So I'm going to come to the end of this line and press enter, and here I'm going to open the command palette, Ctrl+P, and I'm going to type in “create embed.” Here I'm already seeing these four options, so Excalidraw create new drawing, and you can open it in a new workspace tab, so that would be a tab next to it like in your browser; you have tabs. On Windows and on Mac, you can open it in another window, and then it will pop out, and it will be a standalone window. You can open it in an adjacent window; that's what we are going to do right now. So it's going to split the screen in half, and it's going to place Excalidraw on the right-hand side, and I can open it in the current active window. But what this does is when I click here, open in an adjacent window, then you see here that I have a black box, and then I draw here, and I click back; that drawing will appear, and as I continue to draw, then this drawing will appear on the left-hand side. So this is a very convenient way to get an Excalidraw drawing immediately in the place where you want to embed it. The magic starts when you start to add links to Excalidraw, and this is where Excalidraw starts to stand out from other drawing tools because here I can—I have multiple ways of adding links. Now I'm going to show you how you can drag and drop a link in here. I'm going to click here on my first note; you can see it here, and I'm going to drag it over here, and when I let go of the mouse button, then you can see here that this link was created. If I click on this link, then my note opens, and so I can create active documents here that I'm able to navigate. Now, if you don't like these brackets around this, then this is the time when we need to start to look into Excalidraw settings, and we need to start to get familiar with Excalidraw settings. So I'm going to show you a bit about settings. So you find Excalidraw settings here. Under, you click here on settings, and in settings, you will find at the bottom Community Plugins, and you will find Excalidraw. Within settings, this settings has a tremendous amount of different options, so I apologize for that; it gives you great flexibility, but in the beginning, this can be daunting because there's just so much to look at and think about that you really don't know what to look for. But here under links and transclusion, you will see "show brackets around links." If I unclick this setting, then when I come back here, you will see that my double brackets around this note disappeared, and now this note is just there standalone. I can also get rid of the link indicator at the beginning of the note, so the way I would do that is, again, I would come here and scroll down to links and transclusion, and here I can change the prefix. I can either delete it like this or I can add my own characters there; whatever I add here, I'm now going to have this as my prefix, and from then on, my links will look like this. Now I want to show you two more things, and I think then we will need to ramp up. So thing number one, I want to show you is how to add an image, and there's two different ways of adding images. First, I'm going to add an image from outside my Obsidian Vault; it's pretty simple to do. I click here on insert image, and it will open my Explorer, and here I'm just going to choose a random image from my image library, and I'm going to click open. And when I do that, then you can see here that I have my image in here, and I can resize this image and place this image. From now on, this image is in Excalidraw and in Obsidian. Now what I want to show you is if I control-click on this image, and this is where we start to get into a bit more advanced stuff. Depending on what modifier keys you hold down when you click and when you do actions, it will have different effects. If I control-click on the image, the image will be opened as a separate file because, in fact, when I embedded this image, this was not embedded into Excalidraw as in the Excalidraw file, but here if I look at the file explorer, you will see that the embedded image was added here as a separate file, and I can also rename this image, and I'm going to call this "this is my first image" like this. Then, I first update a file name; Obsidian raises this question: do I want to automatically update links? I recommend to answer with yes; always update. This is one of the superpowers of Obsidian: that you can rename links and move files, and your connections will stay intact. Also, this is one of the powers of Excalidraw and Obsidian that all of these updates work with Excalidraw as well. So, yes, I'm going to click always update, and I get this message: the files were renamed and updated; if I come back, of course, my file is still here. So a different way to bring in an image—and suppose I already have this image in my Obsidian Vault—so you can see I dropped this image in here, and it was created as "Obsidian icon 4." If I already have an image in my Vault, which I now did—I just dropped it here in this markdown document—I can add that image to Excalidraw as well. Let me show you—for this purpose, and also so that you understand all of this let me show you here two options how you can do that. First of all, I'm going to click here on "insert any file from Vault," and I think this icon here is your friend. Whenever you want to install or insert something here, you can search for the file. Right now, I don't need to search because the most recent file is automatically here, and I can choose here to insert this as an image. With that, this "Obsidian icon" was inserted, and I can move it around. So with this, what I did is I didn't create a copy of this file—this "Obsidian icon"—and this one here, they both point to "Obsidian icon 4." I can prove this to you; if I control-click on this, it opens the file explorer here, and you can see that this is "Obsidian icon 4." So this is how you can start to link content in Obsidian by reusing the same object—in this case, reusing the image. And also here you can notice that with "insert any file," you can insert really any file into Excalidraw, and all of these are going to work. So just to give you another example, I'm going to click here on "insert any file," and I'm going to choose chapter 2. Then I choose this, and I can choose to insert it as a frame, or I can insert it as an image. If I choose to insert it as a frame, then I get this interactive frame here that I can also edit the text. So that's one way to insert it. I recommend that you start to play with all of these features because this is where Excalidraw and Obsidian start to become super powerful. [* ](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1197)

And to close our discussion as a final how to get started with Excalidraw and Obsidian, I want to draw your attention to this icon here. This is the Obsidian tools panel, so this is where you can access lots of additional features that I’ve developed for Obsidian Excalidraw that are not part of the original Excalidraw product. These are the initial tools that you get; again, the best is to try and explore them, and you will find out what they do. What I want to draw your attention to is the scripts library, which if you open this, this brings up a whole library of super useful different types of scripts that you can use to automate certain tasks in Excalidraw. I’m going to show you one here; a random one, but I think it's a fun little script that you might find useful as well. I'm going to install the Text Arch script, so when I click here, it will take me down to the description of the script, and if I click on install the script, you will see a quick message here that the script was installed. If I come back here, then you see that now I have a new button here under the downloaded—I have this circle with the dot-dot-dot in there. The way this works, first of all, I can drag this panel around, and if I click here on top, then it will collapse, so it gets out of my way. I’m going to type here some text, so this is a demonstration of Text Arch; like this, and the way the script works is I select this text element. So I select this piece of text right here, and then I come to my tools panel, and I click the Text Arch script. So I click here, and I'm prompted with this question. So this is the radius of the circle on which I want to place this text. Let's go with 150. If it's not working for you, then of course you can always change the numbers. I'm going to go with 150, and here I can decide if the text should be above or below the arch. So I'm going to go for below, and when I'm done, you can see here that this piece of text was now converted into this arch, where this is a radius of 150 circle. I mean, you can—if I click here on that round item, I can also rotate this element, so you can from here on play with this to your heart's desire to make this text look as you wanted to. [* ](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1652)

So, this is my quick initial glance through Excalidraw and Obsidian. I know I've covered a lot of ground, but I figured that you can always stop the video, go back, take a look at what I'm doing. So I didn't go into the details of explaining everything in very fine detail, but hopefully, you get this sense of what this tool is capable of doing, and you also get a sense of how you get all of this installed in your own vault. The benefit of Obsidian Excalidraw compared to Excalidraw online is that all of these files are saved in your Obsidian vault, and they are yours forever. They're yours for keeping; they're private, as well as they are safe in your own hands or your own device. All of the material you have here—these are text files. We didn't go into that; you can change this. If I come up to the top, if I right-click, I can open this drawing as a markdown document, so I can look under the hood, and here we are not going to look at what's here. Trust me, this is actually pretty useful once you are a power user of Obsidian. What I want to show you is Excalidraw adds as text files in your Obsidian vault, and it is just a much more accessible format than many of the other drawing formats. And I think I'm going to stop at this point. Hopefully, this gives you a good jump-start to using Excalidraw in Obsidian, and I have lots of other videos on my channel that go into all sorts of special features of this tool. I really think that if you're looking for a visual thinking tool that integrates into your knowledge management system, that you can use to update and reference information where you want to link drawings with one another. So this is something I didn't show you, and obviously, I'm unable to stop with the demonstration, but let me show you just one more thing. I have this drawing here in my very first drawing. If I click here on "insert any file," then I can actually scroll down here to this drawing, so I can embed another Excalidraw drawing into one Excalidraw drawing. So then I click this; I can embed this as an image. So you can see here that now I've embedded this other drawing, and if I modify this other drawing—I happen to still have it open right here—so let's say I'm going to change the background color of the circle. Then, when I come back to the place where it was embedded, the color changes. So the features that Excalidraw in Obsidian offer you in terms of linking, embedding, decomposing, and composing your ideas, your visual ideas, it's just simply limitless. I don't think that there's a better tool for personal knowledge management with illustration than Obsidian and Excalidraw today. Of course, hopefully, the future will bring even better tools, but today, even though some of the features in Excalidraw as a plug-in are clunky, I'm a one-man show developing this plug-in, and it really depends on my time and energy how far I can get with it. I think overall this is the tool that is your best choice if you want to capture your knowledge in a complex tool like Obsidian that allows you to connect your ideas, to explore your ideas, and that has infinite extensibility through the set of plugins. As we looked at in the beginning, there are over 1,100 plugins as of today, but this number is continually growing. So hopefully, this gives you a good starting point as well as gives you a bit of enthusiasm to explore Excalidraw and Obsidian. Thank you! [* ](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1992)

[hey everyone jolt here I probably don't](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=0) [need to introduce the scholar draw and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=3) [obsidian all of my videos are about this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=5) [subject so if you're not familiar with](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=8) [excalator and obsidian I recommend](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=10) [watching couple of my other videos in](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=13) [today's video I want to go back to the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=16) [absolute Basics I recognize that most of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=20) [my videos demonstrate Advanced features](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=22) [of excalator and shows you tips and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=25) [tricks of how to get complicated things](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=29) [done and I don't really have many videos](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=31) [about the absolute Basics so I created](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=34) [this curriculum I actually was thinking](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=38) [about creating an excalator course](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=41) [I'm not sure I'm going to get to have](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=44) [the time to make it but I thought maybe](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=47) [I can get started and create couple of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=50) [videos share it and based on the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=52) [feedback we might be able to continue in](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=54) [this course I laid out a course plan you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=57) [can see these Brown boxes that's the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=60) [main thread of the course and then we](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=63) [have some special colors here about](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=67) [Advanced features so those are](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=69) [additional things that we might be](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=72) [covering in this course](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=73) [or in a later course now of course there](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=75) [is no course this is just going to be a](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=78) [session one without the promise that](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=81) [there's going to be a session too but in](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=84) [today's session I want to show you how](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=87) [to get started with ex College drawing](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=90) [obsidian from zero to get you started](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=92) [you first of all need to install](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=96) [obsidian this one I'm not going to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=98) [demonstrate so you can go to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=101) [obsidian.md download obsidian it's a](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=103) [free application it works on your](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=107) [Android and iOS device as well as it](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=110) [works on Linux on Windows on Mac OS it](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=113) [works everywhere so you just go to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=117) [obsidian MD and you get your copy or you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=120) [go to the relevant App Store and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=123) [download it for your own device](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=126) [once you have obsidian downloaded](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=128) [you will need to create a vault so](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=131) [that's what we're going to start off](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=135) [with here I'm going to create a new](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=137) [Vault and this is just going to be my](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=140) [demo of alt I'm going to call this the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=142) [excaled row demo Vault and when you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=145) [create a new vault in obsidian you need](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=149) [to find a location for that I keep all](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=152) [of my volts on my f Drive of course you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=156) [can choose a different location for your](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=159) [vaults as well but this is where I'm](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=162) [going to place this Vault all you need](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=164) [to do is you need to select the folder](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=166) [here you give it a name and you click](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=168) [create](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=171) [once you've created your Vault then you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=173) [get this empty screen](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=176) [and let's just get first of all familiar](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=178) [a little bit with obsidian so here on](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=181) [the left hand side you have a file](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=185) [explorer and if I click here I can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=186) [create a new note and this is going to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=190) [be my first note so obsidian](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=192) [consists of so-called markdown files](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=196) [markdown is a simple markup language](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=199) [that helps you format documents so first](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=202) [of all this is just simply a text editor](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=206) [so I can enter a text that's great I can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=209) [also create headings so for example this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=213) [is](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=216) [chapter one like this and then I can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=217) [continue on with my text so this is how](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=221) [obsidian looks like now so far there's](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=226) [nothing special about this the point](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=229) [where this becomes special is it's](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=232) [extremely simple to link documents to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=235) [one another in obsidian all you need to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=239) [do is you need to open double square](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=241) [brackets and you can enter the name of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=244) [your file that you want to link to so](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=248) [this is my or maybe the way we are going](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=251) [to do this is I'm going to write second](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=256) [note here and I'm going to just type](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=259) [here that this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=264) [is my second note so what you see here](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=267) [is a link the color of the link is dark](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=273) [you will see later on the different](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=276) [colors which means that this note has](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=278) [not yet been created if I click on this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=281) [note then a new file is created you can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=284) [see here on the left hand side](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=287) [you have a second file created and I can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=290) [start to take notes so this is my second](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=293) [note like this and if I want I can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=297) [create additional links here so](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=300) [I'm going to just link here maybe](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=303) [chapter 2 and I'm going to create](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=308) [another link here chapter 3 like this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=310) [and of course if I want to create](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=314) [chapter 2 I can click here and this is](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=316) [the text for chapter two so I think you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=320) [get the idea you can create these links](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=324) [and you can also navigate by clicking on](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=327) [these links and this becomes something](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=330) [like a](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=332) [a set of web pages or your own Wikipedia](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=335) [now there's one more thing I want to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=340) [show you regarding obsidian vanilla and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=342) [then we'll jump to excalator so if I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=346) [modify this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=349) [link here and let me zoom in that you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=351) [can see it better if I modify this link](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=354) [here by adding an exclamation mark in](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=357) [front then suddenly magic happens](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=360) [because instead of just having the link](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=363) [here I have the contents of this page](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=365) [embedded here some people call this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=369) [transclusion you can call it embedding](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=372) [the point is that by adding an](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=375) [exclamation mark in front of the link](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=378) [you change it from a link to an](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=381) [embedding and you can still open the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=384) [page so if I click here to open the link](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=386) [that's going to open chapter 2 and if I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=388) [write this is my second paragraph](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=393) [like this then when I come back I press](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=398) [the back arrow here then of course you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=402) [will see the second paragraph there](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=404) [there](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=406) [so I think for now that's enough about](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=408) [obsidian to get you started](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=411) [the magic happens when you open settings](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=414) [and you come to community plugins and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=417) [you turn on community plugins](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=420) [and I say it's magic because if you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=423) [click here on browse you will see that](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=426) [there are over 1100 Community plugins](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=429) [and this is a growing list of community](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=433) [plugins](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=435) [you name it we have it this plugin store](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=437) [is filled with super powerful Community](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=441) [plugins now we are going to install](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=444) [excaled raw the way you install let's](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=447) [call it raw is you simply click here on](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=449) [excalator this happens to be currently](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=452) [the most downloaded plugin in obsidian](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=455) [later on this might change and then you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=459) [can of course search for excalator as](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=461) [well and after clicking on excali draw](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=464) [you need to click here install and you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=466) [wait a second and you will get this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=470) [message that Excalibur was successfully](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=473) [installed you still need to enable X](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=476) [color draw and when you enable X College](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=479) [row you will get this message this is a](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=481) [pop-up message that I use to first of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=484) [all welcome you so here there's a](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=488) [showcase that I recommend watching it](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=490) [will give you a taste of what Excalibur](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=492) [can do but it can do so so much more](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=495) [than what you can see here in the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=498) [Showcase](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=500) [and then I have updates every now and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=501) [then I include update videos and I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=504) [always include couple of bullet points](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=506) [explaining what I included in the update](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=509) [so if you want to understand what's](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=512) [happening with ex College raw then this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=514) [is a good way to understand it each](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=516) [update will come with a window like this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=518) [right now I'm going to close this and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=522) [I'm going to close the plugin installer](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=525) [as well and I'm going to close settings](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=529) [here as well so for the time being we](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=533) [don't need that so how do you create](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=536) [your very first excolil drawing well the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=539) [absolute simple way to create a drawing](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=544) [is here on the left hand side you see](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=547) [different buttons when you install the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=550) [Excalibur plugin you will see this new](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=554) [icon appear and when you click on disk](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=557) [create a new drawing then excally draw](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=561) [opens and this is your drawing canvas](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=564) [now I think](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=569) [this is pretty self-explanatory so I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=571) [don't think I need to explain too much](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=575) [about it here on the top you see the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=577) [different tools that you can use so for](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=580) [example here I can draw a rectangle and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=583) [here I can add a circle like this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=586) [now you can also set the properties of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=590) [this to do that here on the left hand](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=593) [side you see this menu](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=596) [so let's start with when I have an](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=598) [element selected like in this case this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=601) [rectangle then you see the painters](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=604) [palette appear if I have nothing](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=605) [selected then that's not visible and if](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=607) [I click on the painters palette then](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=610) [voila these all these tools these](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=612) [options these properties pop up and I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=615) [can change the settings for example I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=619) [can add a background color and I can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=622) [also change the fill of this so you can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=625) [see here I'm going to zoom in so you can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=628) [see this that there are different type](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=631) [of patterns or you can give it a solid](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=634) [fill as well as you can change the width](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=637) [of the stroke so here this is the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=641) [thinnest stroke and this is the thickest](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=644) [stroke so this way you can adjust the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=647) [look and feel of this object you can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=651) [also change the stroke style if you want](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=653) [dashed or dotted lines and you can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=657) [change the sloppiness of the line so](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=660) [this is the architect style the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=663) [architect style has precise lines and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=665) [it's really sharp and then the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=668) [cartoonist style is this more rugged](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=671) [looking I actually love this look of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=675) [excalator this is how I fell in love](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=678) [with the tool](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=680) [I think it depends on personal](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=682) [preferences of course which one you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=684) [choose and then you can choose here to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=686) [have sharp edges which means](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=690) [sharp edges or you can have round edges](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=692) [like this and then depending on the tool](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=696) [that you're selecting sometimes you have](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=699) [different options so for example if I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=702) [now click on an arrow and I create this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=705) [Arrow from the rectangle to the circle](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=709) [you can see I have my arrow there now](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=712) [if I select the arrow then you will see](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=717) [that I now have an additional property](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=719) [pop up here and that's the Arrow Head](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=722) [and I can change the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=726) [end of the arrow and I can also change](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=728) [the beginning of the arrow and this way](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=730) [I can adjust how the arrow looks like so](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=733) [you can see here that I'm adjusting the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=737) [arrow](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=739) [the line color is always called The](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=740) [Stroke color and in case of an arrow](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=743) [there isn't a way to fill the arrow with](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=746) [colors and finally here I'm going to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=750) [just add some text so this is going to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=753) [be the hello world message and I'm going](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=755) [to just make this bigger now with the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=760) [text you have some standard sizes so I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=763) [can choose a small medium large and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=766) [extra large I can also](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=769) [change the font family there are only](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=772) [three font families by default](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=775) [later or a more advanced feature of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=778) [excel obsidian is you can add a fourth](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=781) [font but here these are the three basic](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=785) [font faces or font families that you can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=789) [use](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=792) [now](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=793) [this is a text element on its own you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=794) [can also click a rectangle and press](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=798) [enter and then you're creating a sticky](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=801) [note](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=804) [now the nature of sticky notes is the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=805) [text will automatically wrap](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=810) [and you can see also that the sticky](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=814) [note becomes larger as I type so that's](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=817) [a feature of sticky notes that when](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=820) [you're creating a sticky note it will](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=823) [automatically adjust to the size of the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=825) [text if now I make my rectangle wider](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=828) [then you can see how the text rearranges](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=832) [and then I have my sticky note active](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=836) [then I can do a couple of additional](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=839) [settings like I can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=841) [text align to the left or to the right](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=844) [and I can text the line to the top to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=846) [the bottom or to the middle](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=849) [so these are additional options](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=851) [so I think as an initial introduction](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=855) [this is what you would expect from a](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=857) [drawing tool and I think all of these](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=860) [things can be done and lots of other](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=863) [things as well so this is really just a](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=865) [very very very very](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=868) [small tip of the iceberg of what you can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=871) [do with excalator now how do you get](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=874) [this drawing into your note so now if I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=878) [come back here to the second note that](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=882) [we created I can simply add this drawing](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=884) [there are several ways to embed this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=888) [drawing now I'm going to show you an](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=890) [obsidian function that's super important](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=892) [to know about and I'm going to show you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=894) [how to embed xcolia draw here I'm going](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=898) [to press Ctrl P this is command p on a](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=901) [Mac and I'm going to Type X call it raw](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=906) [and you can already see that there's so](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=910) [many](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=915) [options here that you can explore all of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=916) [these now I want to search for the most](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=920) [recently edited drawing and if I click](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=923) [here then that drawing is embedded now](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=927) [you can do couple of basic settings but](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=931) [before we do the settings let me just](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=933) [show you what you can see here so you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=935) [can observe that I have the exclamation](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=938) [mark here so if I take away the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=940) [exclamation mark then this becomes a](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=942) [link to the drawing and if I place the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=946) [exclamation mark here then this embeds](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=949) [the drawing in your note](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=952) [if I want to change the size of this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=955) [drawing I can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=958) [type a pipe character and I can type a](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=960) [number so maybe I want this to be 500](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=964) [wide or I might want this to be 800 wide](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=967) [of course so this is depending on your](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=971) [screen and on your needs you can change](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=974) [the width there are some other settings](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=977) [for now I think let's be happy with this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=979) [now I want to show you another way how](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=982) [you can embed a drawing here and that](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=985) [other way is going to involve again the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=988) [command palette so I'm going to come to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=991) [the end of this line and press enter and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=994) [here I'm going to open the command](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=998) [palette Ctrl p and I'm going to type in](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1000) [create](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1003) [embed and here I'm already seeing these](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1005) [four options so excalator create new](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1010) [drawing and you can open it in a new](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1014) [workspace tab so that would be a tab](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1017) [next to it like in your browser you have](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1020) [tabs](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1023) [on Windows and on Mac you can open it in](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1024) [another window and then it will pop out](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1028) [and it will be a standalone window you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1030) [can open it in an adjacent window that's](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1033) [what we are going to do right now so](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1035) [it's going to split the screen in half](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1037) [and it's going to place excalator on the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1039) [right hand side and I can open it in the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1042) [current active window](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1046) [but what this does is when I click here](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1047) [open in an adjacent window then you see](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1050) [here that I have a black box and then I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1053) [draw here](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1056) [and I click back then that drawing will](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1057) [appear and as I continue to draw then](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1060) [this drawing will appear on the left](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1065) [hand side so this is a very convenient](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1068) [way to get an excolil drawing](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1070) [immediately in the place where you want](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1073) [to embed it the magic starts when you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1077) [start to add links to ex College room](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1081) [and this is where excalator starts to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1084) [stand out from other drawing tools](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1087) [because here I can I have multiple ways](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1089) [of adding links now I'm going to show](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1094) [you how you can drag and drop a link in](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1096) [here I'm going to take click here on my](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1099) [first note you can see it here and I'm](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1103) [going to drag it over here and when I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1105) [let go of the mouse button then you can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1109) [see here that this link was created and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1111) [if I click on this link](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1116) [and then my note opens and so I can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1118) [create active documents here](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1122) [that I'm able to navigate now if you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1125) [don't like these brackets around this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1129) [then this is the time when we need to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1132) [start to look into X collateral settings](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1134) [and we need to start to get familiar](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1137) [with X collateral settings so](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1140) [I'm going to show you a bit about](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1142) [setting so you find X collateral](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1144) [settings here](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1147) [under you click here on settings and in](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1149) [settings you will find at the bottom](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1152) [Community plugins and you will find](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1155) [x-colored raw and within settings so](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1157) [this settings has tremendous amount of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1161) [different options so I apologize for](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1165) [that it gives you great flexibility but](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1168) [in the beginning this can be daunting](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1170) [because there's just so much to look at](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1173) [and think about that you really don't](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1177) [know what to look for but here under](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1180) [links and transclusion you will see show](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1183) [brackets around links if I unclick this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1188) [setting then](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1193) [when I come back here you will see that](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1195) [my double bracket from around this note](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1198) [disappeared and now this note is just](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1202) [there Standalone I can also get rid of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1206) [this link indicator at the beginning of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1209) [the note so the way I would do that is](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1213) [again I would come here and I would](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1215) [scroll down to links and transclusion](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1218) [and here I can change the prefix I can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1222) [either delete it like this or I can add](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1226) [my own characters there whatever I add](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1229) [here I'm now going to have this as my](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1233) [prefix and from then on my links will](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1236) [look like this now I want to show you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1240) [two more things and I think then we will](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1242) [need to ramp up so thing number one I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1245) [want to show you is how to add an image](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1249) [and there's two different ways of adding](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1252) [images](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1257) [first I'm going to add an image from](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1258) [outside my obsidian Vault it's pretty](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1260) [simple to do I click here on insert](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1263) [image and it will open my Explorer and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1266) [here I'm just going to choose a random](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1271) [image from my image library and I'm](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1274) [going to click open and when I do that](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1277) [then you can see here that I have my](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1280) [image in here and I can resize this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1283) [image place this image and from now on](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1287) [this image is in excali draw and in](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1291) [obsidian now what I want to show you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1294) [is if I control click on this image so](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1297) [and this is where we start to get into a](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1302) [bit more advanced stuff so depending on](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1305) [what modifier Keys you hold down when](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1308) [you click and when you do actions it](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1312) [will have different effects if I control](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1314) [click on the image the image will be](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1317) [opened as a separate file because in](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1321) [fact when I embedded this image](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1323) [this was not embedded into](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1327) [ex collateral as in the ex collateral](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1331) [file but here if I look at the file](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1334) [explorer you will see that the embedded](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1337) [image was added here as a separate file](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1340) [and I can also rename this image and I'm](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1343) [going to call this this is my first](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1347) [image like this and then I first update](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1350) [a file name obsidian raises this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1355) [question do I want to automatically](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1358) [update links I recommend to answer with](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1360) [yes always update this is one of the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1365) [super powers of obsidian that you can](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1368) [rename links and move files and your](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1371) [your connections will stay intact and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1374) [also this is one of the powers of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1377) [excalator and obsidian that all of these](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1380) [updates work with excalator as well so](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1383) [yes I'm going to click always update and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1386) [I get this message the files were re](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1388) [named and updated and if I come back of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1391) [course my file is still here so a](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1394) [different way to bring in an image and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1397) [suppose I already have this image in my](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1399) [obsidian Vault so you can see I dropped](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1404) [this image in here and it was created as](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1406) [obsidian icon 4. if I already have an](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1411) [image in my vault which I now did I just](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1415) [dropped it here in this markdown](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1418) [document I can add that image to X call](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1420) [it raw as well and let me show you for](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1425) [this purpose and also that you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1428) [understand all of this let me show you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1430) [here two options how you can do that](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1432) [first of all I'm going to click here on](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1434) [the insert any file from vault](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1437) [and I think this icon here is your](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1441) [friend whenever you want to install or](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1444) [insert something here you can search for](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1446) [the file right now I don't need to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1449) [search because the most recent file is](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1451) [automatically here and I can choose here](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1454) [to insert this as an image and with that](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1457) [this obsidian icon was inserted and I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1460) [can move it around so with this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1464) [what I did is I didn't create a copy of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1467) [this file this obsidian image and this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1471) [one here they both point to obsidian](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1475) [icon for I can prove this to you if I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1478) [control click on this it opens the file](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1481) [explorer here and you can see that this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1485) [is Obsidian icon for](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1488) [so this is how you can start to link](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1491) [content in obsidian by reusing the same](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1495) [object so in this case reusing the image](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1500) [and also here you can notice that with](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1504) [insert any file you can insert really](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1507) [any file into a scholar draw and all of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1509) [these are going to work so just to give](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1513) [you another example I'm going to click](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1515) [here on insert any file and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1517) [choose chapter 2 then I choose this I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1520) [can choose to insert it as a frame or I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1523) [can insert it as an image if I choose to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1527) [insert it as a frame then I get this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1529) [interactive frame here that I can also](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1533) [edit the text so that's one way to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1536) [insert it I recommend that you start to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1539) [play with all of these features because](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1542) [this is where exclusion obsidian starts](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1545) [to become super powerful](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1549) [and to close our](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1551) [discussion as a final how to get started](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1553) [with excalator and obsidian I want to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1558) [draw your attention to this icon here](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1561) [this is the obsidian tools panel](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1563) [so this is where you can access lots of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1567) [additional features that I've developed](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1570) [for obsidian X collateral that are not](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1573) [part of the original ex collateral](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1577) [product and these are the initial tools](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1579) [that you get again the best is to try](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1583) [and explore them and you will find out](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1588) [what they do what I want to draw your](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1590) [attention to is the scripts Library](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1593) [which if you open this this brings up a](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1597) [whole library of super useful different](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1602) [type of scripts that you can use to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1606) [automate certain tasks in excalator I'm](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1610) [going to show you one here](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1614) [a random one but it I think it's a fun](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1616) [little script that you might find useful](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1620) [as well I'm going to install the text](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1624) [Arch](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1626) [script so when I click here it will take](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1628) [me down to the description of the script](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1631) [and if I click on install the script you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1633) [will see a quick message here that the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1637) [script was installed and if I come back](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1640) [here then you see that now I have a new](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1643) [button here under the downloaded I have](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1647) [this circle with the dot dot dot in](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1650) [there and the way this works first of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1653) [all I can drag this panel around and if](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1656) [I click here on top then it will](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1659) [collapse so it gets out of my way I'm](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1662) [going to type here some text so](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1665) [this is a](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1668) [demonstration of text Arch like this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1670) [and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1675) [the way the script works is I select](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1677) [this text element so I select this piece](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1680) [of text right here](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1683) [and then I come to my tools panel and I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1685) [click the text Arch script so I click](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1690) [here](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1693) [and I'm prompted with this question so](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1694) [this is the radius of the circle on](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1697) [which I want to place this text let's go](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1700) [with 150 if it's not working for you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1703) [then of course you can always change the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1706) [numbers I'm going to go with 150 and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1707) [here I can decide if the text should be](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1711) [above or below the arch so I'm going to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1713) [go for below and when I'm done then you](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1717) [can see here that this piece of text was](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1721) [now converted into this Arch where this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1724) [is a radius of 150 Circle and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1727) [I mean you can if I click here on that](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1733) [round item I can also rotate this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1736) [element so you can you can from here on](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1739) [play with this to your heart's desire to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1741) [make this text look as you wanted to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1744) [so this is my quick initial glance](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1747) [through excalator and obsidian I know](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1752) [I've covered a lot of ground but I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1755) [figured that you can always stop the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1758) [video go back take a look at what I'm](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1760) [doing so I didn't go into the details of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1763) [explaining everything in very fine](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1767) [detail but hopefully you get this sense](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1769) [of what this tool is capable of doing](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1772) [and you also get a sense of how you get](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1775) [all of this installed in your own Vault](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1778) [the benefit of obsidian ex college or](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1782) [compared to excalator online is all of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1785) [these files are saved in your obsidian](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1788) [bolt and they are yours forever they're](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1790) [yours for keeping they're private as](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1794) [well as they are safe in your own hands](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1797) [or your own device all of the material](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1800) [you have here these are tax files we](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1804) [didn't go into to that you can change](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1806) [this if I come up to the Top If I right](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1810) [click I can open this drawing as a](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1813) [markdown document so I can look under](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1817) [the hood and here we are not going to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1820) [look at what's here trust me this is](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1822) [actually pretty useful once you are a](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1825) [power user of a solid robot these what I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1828) [want to show you is excaled roll divs as](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1831) [text files](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1834) [in your obsidian Vault and it is just a](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1836) [much more accessible format than many of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1840) [the other drawing formats and I think](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1843) [I'm going to stop at this point](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1846) [hopefully this gives you a good jump](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1849) [start to using excalatorian obsidian](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1852) [and I have lots of other videos on my](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1856) [channel that go into all sorts of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1859) [special features of this tool](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1861) [I really think that if you're looking](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1864) [for a visual thinking tool that](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1866) [integrates into your knowledge](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1869) [management system that you can use to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1871) [update and reference information where](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1875) [you want to link drawings with one](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1878) [another so this is something I didn't](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1880) [show you and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1882) [obviously I'm unable to stop with the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1884) [demonstration but let me show you just](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1887) [one more thing so I have this drawing](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1889) [here in my very first drawing](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1892) [if I click here on insert any file then](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1895) [I can actually scroll down here to this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1899) [drawing so I can embed another Excalibur](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1903) [drawing into One X collateral drawing so](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1906) [then I click this I can embed this as an](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1909) [image so you can see here that now I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1912) [embedded this other drawing](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1915) [and if I modify this other drawing I](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1918) [have I happen to still have it open](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1921) [right here so let's say I'm going to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1924) [change the background color of the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1926) [circle then when I come back to the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1929) [place where it was embedded the color](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1932) [changes so the features the scholarly](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1934) [draw in obsidian offer you in terms of](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1938) [linking embedding decomposing and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1941) [composing your ideas your visual ideas](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1944) [it's just simply Limitless](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1949) [I don't think that there's a better tool](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1952) [for personal Knowledge Management with](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1954) [illustration than obsidian and ex](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1957) [collateral today of course hopefully the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1959) [future will bring even better tools but](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1962) [today](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1965) [even though some of the features in ex](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1967) [College role as a plug-in are clunky I'm](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1969) [a one-man show developing this plugin](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1973) [and it really depends on my time and](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1976) [energy how far I can get with it I think](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1979) [overall this](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1983) [is the tool that](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1985) [is your best choice if you want to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1989) [capture your knowledge in a complex](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1992) [tool like obsidian that allows you to](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1996) [connect your ideas to explore your ideas](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=1999) [and that has](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=2002) [infinite extensibility is through the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=2004) [set of plugins as we looked at the](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=2008) [beginning there are 1100 over 1100](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=2009) [plugins as of today but this number is](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=2013) [continually growing](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=2015) [so hopefully this gives you a good](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=2017) [starting point as well as gives you a](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=2019) [bit of enthusiasm to explore excalatory](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=2022) [and obsidian](https://youtu.be/QKnQgSjJVuc?t=2026) [thank
