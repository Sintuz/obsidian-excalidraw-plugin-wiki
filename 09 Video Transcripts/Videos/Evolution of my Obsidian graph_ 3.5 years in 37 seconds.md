In this video, we will take a look at the evolution of my Obsidian graph over the past 3.5 years, all captured in just 37 seconds. This visual representation demonstrates how my ideas and knowledge developed and interconnected during this time period. I emphasize the importance of visual tools as part of my Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) strategy. [* ](https://youtu.be/E8gB2SGCDC4?t=0)

As I reflect on my journey, I notice how the graph visually demonstrates the complex relationships between various concepts I have explored. Each node and connection represents a piece of information or an insight that has contributed to the overall structure of my knowledge. The growth of this graph is a testament to my learning process and the power of using Obsidian effectively. [* ](https://youtu.be/E8gB2SGCDC4?t=10)

Over time, I have integrated tools like Excalidraw and ExcaliBrain to enhance my PKM experience. These visual resources allow me to express my ideas creatively, enabling a deeper understanding of the connections I make. This approach has proven invaluable in not just capturing knowledge, but also in visualizing it in a way that promotes further exploration and discovery. [* ](https://youtu.be/E8gB2SGCDC4?t=20)

In conclusion, my Obsidian graph serves as a powerful representation of my intellectual journey over the last 3.5 years. I encourage others to explore visual PKM strategies through tools like Obsidian and Excalidraw, as they can significantly enhance learning and idea generation. Thank you for watching!
