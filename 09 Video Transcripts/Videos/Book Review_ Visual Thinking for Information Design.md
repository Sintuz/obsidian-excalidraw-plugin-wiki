# Summary
In this video, Zsolt reviews the book "Visual Thinking for Information Design" by Colin Ware, highlighting its wealth of insights into effective visual communication. He emphasizes the importance of understanding cognitive processes, such as predictive cognition and active vision, and how these can aid in designing better visualizations. Zsolt also shares his personal reflections and practical applications derived from the book, suggesting its value for anyone interested in improving their information design skills.

# Key Takeaways
- Visual thinking involves a dynamic interaction between internal mental models and external visual stimuli.
- Understanding predictive cognition can help designers align their visuals with the audience's mental frameworks.
- Effective visual design should facilitate information retrieval by providing clear reference points that resonate with viewers' expectations.

# Content
Hey everyone, it's Zsolt here. I'm in eastern Slovenia on holiday and I'm reading "Visual Thinking for Information Design" by Colin Ware. I'm not yet done with the book, but it is so rich in useful information that I thought I would share with you what I've learned from it so far. Maybe I'll cover the rest in an upcoming video. I stumbled upon this book as I was doing research for my previous video, and if you've not seen this, I recommend watching it. It's a scientific discussion about the value of visuals and how they compare to words. Of course, reading this book is a bit of an understatement; I'm really studying it. I created, or started to create, this concept map, and of course, I have my book chapter summaries. Each mind map is a summary of a different chapter, and there are many more chapters to go. You can see that I've captured a lot of ideas as I was reading. Many of these concepts are new to me, and they are really super useful and helpful material. The promise Colin makes is that by understanding this, it will help you decide which colors to use, how to organize space, when to use images or words, and this will make your diagrams, your slides, or whatever visual delivery you do better. You'll be better equipped to communicate the information you want to share with your audience, or rather, what your audience needs to know. [* ](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=0)

Now, the book is so good that I'm actually thinking that maybe for cohort 11 of the Visual Thinking Workshop, this is going to be the book that we read together. A quick reminder: cohort 10 is starting in a week's time, and you still have time to sign up if you want to. Now, the starting idea, or the way Colin starts his book, is about the dance between internal and external information. He defines seeing as not a passive activity. It's not about me looking at something and that's it; it's a dance between internal and external information. He talks about a bottom-up information channel, which involves seeing features, patterns, identifying objects, etc., and there's a top-down process based on your attention. Based on your objectives, you will plan your next eye movements, directing your seeing and your pattern recognition based on the visual query you have in mind. So these two together form this dance of visual thinking, visual seeing, essentially. [* ](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=41)

Colin covers a couple of basic concepts. The first one is predictive cognition, which is about the mental models you build to understand certain situations. Colin states that memories are not just there to reminisce about the past; that's sort of a side effect. Memories are predictive models guiding future action. For example, when you walk into a supermarket, your brain will pull from its memory all the historical supermarket experiences, helping you orient yourself quickly. You'll see things and be able to find your groceries or whatever else you need quickly because you'll have a mental model of the space that you entered. Similarly, if you pick up a map or look at a slide, you will always immediately bring with yourself your mental model of how those certain visual situations work. Of course, if you enter the supermarket and things are organized very differently, you'll be frustrated because your mental model doesn't fit with your experiences. [* ](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=90)

Now, why do you need to know this? It's because when you design a visualization, you need to understand what mental models are available in the heads of your audience, and you need to tune your visualization to them. You need to make sure there are certain reference points that your audience can find in the material so they can orient themselves and find what they need quickly. So here on the right-hand side, you can see that the audience comes with different questions, visual queries, and the visual you provide should serve as a reference point that helps them orient themselves and then find the information. The task of the visual designer is to create these visual experiences that feel seamless, where it's easy to find information. We'll talk about this in just a couple of minutes, but I thought it was interesting to mention this example from the book. First, your task is to find the P's, and of course, you can very quickly find the two P's. The second task is to find the Q's, and it will take quite some time to find the Q's. Think about why it's more difficult to find the Q's and why it's easy to find the P's; you need to understand the mechanism behind this so that you can design the space for your audience. Colin talks about several layers of information processing in our brain, including the retinal image and then feature processing, constructing patterns, identifying objects, and binding objects to ideas in our mind. Some of these elements of this process, especially those at the top, like feature processing, are much more automatic and uniform than the later steps. If you understand what's happening at the feature processing level and what is occurring at the pattern construction level, you can target your visual material to the right place. [* ](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=167)

Moving on, another concept that Colin mentions is about active vision. He starts with the idea that graphic designs are cognitive tools; they enhance and extend our brains. This reminds me of the idea of the “Detachment Gain” that I read about in "The Extended Mind" by Annie Murphy Paul. The idea of the detachment gain is that if you take your ideas and put them on a whiteboard, you can take a step back and observe them in a spatial setup. This distance between your ideas on the whiteboard and yourself creates an opportunity to reflect, and that's the detachment gain. Visual thinking is always about pattern finding; it utilizes your brain's pattern-finding abilities, and very often, to see a pattern is to understand the solution to a problem. Think of a map: the moment you can see your origin and destination, you can trace the line and know which tube or subway you need to take to get from one station to the other. In this case, you can understand how pattern finding serves as your solution. The hallmark of a good visual thinking tool is that it is easier to use the tool than to rely solely on memory. [* ](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=274)

Now, moving on from here, a very important idea, and a central theme in the book, is that at any moment in time, we perceive only a very small portion of our surroundings. It's an illusion that we see the entire world, and this has to do with how our eyes work. Colin makes a comparison between a digital camera and the human eye. There are many similarities: both have receptors and send information to some sort of processing unit. However, there are two very important differences. The first difference is pixel distribution; in a digital camera, pixels are uniformly distributed in a picture, so you will have the same density of pixels in the top left as in the center or the bottom right. This isn't true for your eye. In the fovea, the central part of your eye, about 95% of your receptors are located, meaning 5% of the eye has 95% of the receptors. As you go out to the edges, you will have less and less receptors, which is why your peripheral vision is blurred. That's one difference. The other difference is what I call edge computing: we don't send all the information back to our brain, but instead, it goes through several layers of processing. By the time our mind works with the ideas, it is somewhat detached from the original pixels, and as part of this process, some steps are built-in. I wouldn’t say they are hardcoded because feature processing is something you learn as an infant, but there are elements of this process that you cannot actually control. [* ](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=386)

Now, this leads us to the idea that the world is its own memory. Because our attentional capacity is limited, we quickly forget irrelevant information, replacing it with information that we currently need. It's somewhat like this: this is a map of the world, but you will only focus on the small part that you need from that information. This is your entire environment, and you're only going to focus on the pieces of information that you immediately need. Often, you don't even realize this because you can access additional information with rapid, unconscious glances that you don’t even notice. But, in reality, this is how you see: you will see only that point, and the rest you will sort of imagine. It's only an illusion that you have the rest there. From this perspective, seeing is all about attention, and attention is driven by visual queries and, of course, influenced by the mental models you are using to guide your attention. [* ](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=558)

Now, let's go back to the example about the P and conclude this video with practical examples of how you can apply what we've discussed. Why do P's stand out while Q's do not? To understand this, you need to comprehend how the feature processing occurs at the earlier stages and through deeper cortical layers. Some of the feature processing is automatic; you don't have control over it. There are experiments that look at why P's stand out while Q's don't, and they always include a shape and distractors. Indeed, in this case, you'll see that there are two types of shapes that stand out; there's the big bubble that stands out, but also, the red lines will stand out in the visual field. [* ](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=636)

What stands out does so because of what are called visual distances, which refer to the contrast between an object and its surroundings. The book includes examples of various features our brains distinguish. I won’t go through all of these, as some are stronger and some less strong. For instance, convex and concave objects stand out less than gray value differences or shape differences. Also, consider why the three green squares do not stand out in this example—again, following the previous logic. To understand why a Q does not stand out, you need to be familiar with feature space diagrams. On this diagram, you can see the color on one axis and the size on the other. When you categorize all the objects in a field of vision according to these axes, you will see clusters, or sometimes, you may not see any clusters but bubbles scattered throughout the space. If an object stands apart from that cluster per the features presented, it will stand out. You can do this in multiple dimensions; there are various features, and you can create diagrams where different elements stand out for different reasons. Here’s an example where multiple dimensions are nicely displayed; you can see one is a color dimension, and the other is a shape dimension. Compared to the green and red circles and squares, this one stands out pretty well because the distances are larger and because these various shapes are clustered nicely. [* ](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=925)

Finally, to conclude the conversation, Colin explains another approach about using multiscale structures to design for search. In this case, you will first look for the structural part where the information you need is, and then with the next glance, or a third glance, find the actual information you want. For example, think of a diagram where you know the legend is in the top right, or the title is at the top left. When you look at the chart, you know that if you need to find the legend, you'll look for a box around it, allowing you to find that information quickly before you dive in to learn about the actual details. So that’s in a nutshell what I wanted to share. There's lots more I didn't talk about regarding the bottom mind map, but I think this has already been a long enough conversation. I hope you found this summary helpful. If you're interested in learning about this and applying it to your personal knowledge management and your workflows, I cover many similar topics in the Visual Thinking Workshop, cohort 10, which starts in a week. If you're interested in this subject, I recommend picking up this book. It is dense and difficult if you’re not familiar with the subject as I am, so you’ll likely take many notes, but it's also super interesting and very hands-on. There’s theoretical discussion about how your brain works and how your mental systems machinery works, but the discussion is neither too detailed nor too superficial; it gives grounding to understand the different tools and approaches Colin explains for organizing and presenting information. Thank you for taking the time to watch the entire video, and I’d love to hear your thoughts about this.

This video reviews Colin Ware's book: Visual Thinking for Information Design. While I have only read the first one-third of the book it has already been extremely insightful. I wanted to share what I learned from the book so far. In the video, I talk about concepts such as Predictive Cognition, Active Vision, Visual Queries and mental maps, the bottom-up information-driven and top-down attention-driven visual processes, and explore visual distances to design standout features.

visual thinking visual see](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=189) [or seeing](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=193) [essentially so Colin covers a couple of](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=195) [basic concepts the first one is](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=198) [predictive](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=201) [cognition and predictive cognition is](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=202) [about the mental models you build up to](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=205) [understand understand certain situations](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=209) [Colin states that memories are not there](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=212) [to reminiscent over the past that's sort](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=216) [of a side effect memories are predictive](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=219) [models guiding future action so for](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=223) [example when you walk into a](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=226) [supermarket your brain will pull from](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=228) [its memory all the history Supermarket](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=231) [experiences and they'll help you Orient](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=235) [yourself you'll see the a quickly you'll](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=237) [be able to find your groceries or](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=240) [whatever else you need quickly because](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=243) [you'll have a mental model of the space](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=245) [that you entered and similarly if you](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=248) [pick up a map or if you look at a slide](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=251) [you will always immediately bring with](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=254) [yourself your mental model of how those](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=257) [certain visual situations work and of](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=262) [course if for example you enter the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=265) [supermarket and Things Are organized](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=267) [very differently you'll be frustrated](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=271) [because your mental model doesn't fit](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=274) [with your](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=276) [experiences](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=278) [now why do you need to know this it's](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=280) [because when](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=283) [you design a visualization you need to](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=284) [understand what mental models are](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=288) [available or are in the head of your](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=290) [audience and you need to tune your](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=294) [visualization to them you need to make](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=296) [sure that there are certain reference](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=299) [points that your audience can find in](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=302) [the material so they can Orient](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=305) [themselves and find what they need](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=308) [quickly so here on the right hand side](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=311) [you can see that image that your](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=314) [audience comes with different questions](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=317) [visual queries and the visual that you](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=319) [provide should provide some reference](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=323) [point that helps them Orient themselves](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=326) [and then find the information and the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=329) [task of the visual designer is to create](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=332) [these visual experiences that feel](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=337) [seamless where it's easy to find](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=340) [information and we'll talk about this in](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=343) [just a couple of minutes but I thought](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=347) [here it's an interesting point to](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=349) [mention um this example in the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=352) [book so first your task is to find the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=355) [the P's and of course you can very](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=359) [quickly find the two PS the second task](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=362) [is to find the q's and it will take](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=365) [quite some time to find the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=368) [cues and think about why is it more](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=370) [difficult to find the cues and why is it](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=374) [easy to find the P's because you need to](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=377) [understand the mechanism behind this so](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=381) [that you can design the space for your](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=383) [audience and in this process Colin talks](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=387) [about this several layers of information](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=391) [processing in our brain the retinal](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=394) [image and then the feature processing](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=398) [constructing patterns identifying](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=400) [objects binding objects to ideas in our](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=402) [mind and so on and some of these](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=405) [elements of this process especially the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=410) [ones at the top for example feature](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=412) [processing are much more automatic and](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=415) [uniform than the later one so if you](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=419) [understand what's happening at the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=423) [feature processing level what is](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=425) [happening at the pattern Construction](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=427) [level you can Target your visual](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=430) [material to the right](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=432) [place now moving on the other concept](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=435) [that Colin mentions is about Active](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=441) [Vision and he starts with this idea that](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=444) [graphic design designs are cognitive](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=448) [tools they enhance and extend our brains](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=451) [and this actually reminded me of this](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=454) [idea of the Detachment gain that I read](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=458) [in the extended Mind by Annie Murphy](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=462) [Paul the idea of the Detachment gain is](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=465) [if you take your ideas and put them on a](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=468) [whiteboard you can take a step back and](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=471) [observe them in a spatial setup and this](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=474) [distance between your ideas on the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=479) [Whiteboard and yourself](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=482) [creates an opportunity to reflect and](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=485) [that's the Detachment gain](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=488) [now when you look at a visual visual](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=491) [thinking is always about pattern finding](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=495) [it uses your brain's pattern finding](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=499) [abilities and very often to see a](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=501) [pattern is to understand the solution to](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=505) [a problem so think of this situation of](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=507) [a map the moment you can see your origin](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=510) [and destination and you can trace the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=514) [line you know which tube or Subway you](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=516) [need to take to get from one station to](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=520) [the other so in this](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=523) [case you can understand how the pattern](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=525) [finding is your solution actually and](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=529) [that and the whole Mark of a good visual](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=532) [thinking tool is that it's easier to use](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=535) [the tool than to do everything in](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=538) [memory now moving on from here a very](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=542) [important idea and I think a central](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=547) [idea in the book is that at any moment](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=550) [of time the perceive only a very small](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=553) [portion of our](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=557) [surroundings it's only an illusion that](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=558) [we see the entire world and this has to](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=561) [do with how our eyes work and Callin](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=565) [makes this comparison between a digital](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=569) [camera and r i and there are many](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=572) [similarities so both have receptors and](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=576) [both will then send the information to](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=579) [some sort of a processing unit Etc but](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=583) [there are two very important this](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=586) [differences difference number one is the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=589) [pixel distribution in a digital camera](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=592) [you have pixels uniformly distributed on](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=595) [the pictures so you will have the same](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=598) [density of pixels in the top left as in](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=601) [the center or the bottom right not in](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=604) [your eye so in the FAA in the central](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=606) [part of your eye you'll have about](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=610) [95% of your receptor so that's 5% of the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=614) [eye has 95% of The receptors and as you](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=618) [go out to the edges you will have less](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=622) [and less receptors so that's why your](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=627) [peripherial vision is blurred so that's](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=629) [one difference the other difference is](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=633) [this difference about what I call Edge](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=636) [Computing that actually we don't send](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=639) [the entire information back to our brain](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=642) [but it goes through these several layers](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=645) [of processing and by the time our mind](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=648) [works with the ideas it is sort of](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=651) [detached from the original pixels and in](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=654) [this process some of the steps are sort](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=657) [of built in they are I wouldn't say](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=661) [hardcoded because feature processing is](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=663) [something you learn as an infant but](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=666) [there are elements of this process that](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=670) [you cannot actually](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=672) [control and so moving on from here this](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=674) [takes us to this concept that the world](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=679) [is its own memory so because our](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=682) [attentional capacity is so limited](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=686) [we forget irrelevant information very](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=689) [quickly and it's replaced by information](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=692) [that we currently need so it's sort of](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=695) [like this that this is a map of the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=698) [world but you will only focus on the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=701) [small part that you need from that](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=705) [information so this is your entire envir](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=708) [environment and you're only going to](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=710) [focus on the pieces of information that](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=712) [you immediately need and often you don't](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=715) [even realize this because you can so](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=717) [rapidly and unconsciously access the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=721) [additional information with additional](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=724) [glances that you don't even notice it](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=726) [but in reality this is how you see you](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=729) [will see only that point the rest you](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=732) [will sort of imagine it's only an](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=735) [illusion that you have the rest is there](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=738) [so from this perspective seeing is all](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=742) [about attention and attention is driven](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=746) [by the visual queries and of course](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=750) [driven by the mental models that you're](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=753) [using to guide your](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=756) [attention so if you now go back to this](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=758) [example about the p and try to conclude](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=762) [this video with some practical examples](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=765) [of how you can apply what we've](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=769) [discussed so far so why do P's stand out](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=771) [and why do Q's not stand out](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=775) [so to understand this you need to again](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=779) [understand how the feature processing](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=782) [which is at level one and level two here](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=785) [on this diagram of the brain happens](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=788) [earlier in the processing as deeper uh](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=791) [cortical layers and some of the feature](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=796) [processing is really automatic you you](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=799) [don't really have control over them and](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=803) [this is just another way how this](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=807) [hierarchy of understanding works that on](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=810) [the left you see your eye and as you](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=813) [move to the right you have more and more](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=816) [control attentional control over what's](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=819) [happening at the features level features](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=822) [are sort of automatic and](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=827) [irresistible so the experiments that](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=830) [look at why p and Q from the previous](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=834) [example one stands out the other doesn't](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=839) [always include a shape and](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=842) [distractors and indeed in this case you](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=845) [can see that there are two types of](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=848) [shapes that stand out of course there's](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=851) [the big bubble that stands out but also](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=854) [the red lines will stand out and you'll](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=856) [see why uh in a](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=859) [second but what stands out stands out](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=862) [this pop out effect happens because of](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=866) [what are called visual](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=869) [distances which is the contrast between](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=872) [an object and its](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=876) [surrounding and so the book includes](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=879) [these](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=882) [examples of various features that our](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=883) [brain distinguishes so you can I'm not](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=888) [going to walk through on all of these](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=891) [some of these are stronger and some of](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=893) [these are less strong so for example](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=896) [convex and concave will stand out less](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=899) [than for example a gray value difference](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=903) [or a shape](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=907) [difference and then you should also](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=909) [think about why the three green squares](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=912) [do not stand out here so again following](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=916) [the previous logic why did the Q stand](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=920) [out and why did or why did the p stand](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=924) [out and the Q didn't so why does doesn't](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=926) [the green box stand out on this](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=929) [picture and to understand all of this](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=935) [you need to understand about these](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=939) [feature space diagrams what you can see](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=941) [on this](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=944) [diagram is on the two axis one one the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=945) [vertical axis is the color the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=949) [horizontal axis is the size and so when](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=952) [you take all the objects in a field of](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=955) [vision](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=958) [and you categorize them based on this](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=959) [then you will see some clusters or maybe](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=961) [you will not see any clusters but](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=964) [bubbles all over the place if you see a](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=967) [cluster and if you see an object that's](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=970) [separate from that cluster from the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=973) [perspective of these features then that](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=976) [item will stand out and of course you](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=979) [can do this in multiple Dimensions so on](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=981) [the previous chart you could see that](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=984) [there are many different features so you](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=987) [can put these all together and create](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=990) [diagrams where different elements stand](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=993) [out for different reasons so here's an](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=996) [example where there are multiple](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=999) [Dimensions that stand out nicely so you](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1002) [can see one is a color Dimension the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1005) [other is a shape Dimension and compared](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1009) [to the green and red circles and squares](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1014) [this one actually stands out pretty](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1019) [nicely because the distances are bigger](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1021) [because these various shapes are in](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1026) [clusters and then for the features of](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1031) [the shapes are in clusters and then](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1034) [here's another example where you can](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1037) [even combine multiple items to make an](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1039) [even stronger uh](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1042) [pop then finally to conclude](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1046) [uh the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1049) [conversation there's another approach](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1051) [that Colin explains and this is about](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1054) [using multiscale structures to](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1057) [design uh for search and in this case](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1060) [you will First Look for the structural](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1064) [part where the information you need is](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1066) [and then you'll dive in with the next](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1070) [glance or a third glance to find the](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1073) [actual information you want so for](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1076) [example think of a diagram where you](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1078) [know that the legend is on the top uh](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1081) [right hand side and then immediately or](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1084) [the title is the top left so when you](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1088) [look at the chart you know that if I](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1091) [need to find the legend I'm going to](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1093) [find it it's going to have maybe a box](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1095) [around it and then with the next glance](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1098) [you can look at the legend itself and](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1101) [learn about the information that's there](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1104) [so that's](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1107) [in a nutshell there's lots more I didn't](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1109) [talk about the bottom mind map but I](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1112) [think this was already long enough as a](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1114) [conversation I hope you found this](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1118) [summary helpful](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1121) [and yeah if you're interested in](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1123) [learning about this and how to apply it](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1127) [to your personal Knowledge Management to](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1130) [your own workflows I cover many similar](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1132) [topics in the visual thinking Workshop](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1135) [cohort 10 starts in a week](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1138) [time but equally if you're interested in](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1141) [this I recommend picking up this book](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1144) [this is a dense and difficult book if](https://youtu.be/oAcUH3GDmfQ?t=1147)
