![Building Apps with GPT-4 Vision Preview using an Excalidraw Automate Script in Obsidian.md](https://youtu.be/y3kHl_6Ll4w)

# Summary
In this video, the presenter Zsolt showcases an exciting new script he developed for Obsidian.md, utilizing Excalidraw and GPT-4 Vision in a way that automates UI generation. He demonstrates how the script can recreate dynamic elements, such as a moving clock, based on simple drawings and instructions. Zsolt encourages viewers to try out the script themselves, highlighting its accessibility and user-friendly setup process.

# Key Takeaways
- Zsolt created a script for Obsidian.md that allows automation of UI elements using Excalidraw and GPT-4.
- The script can generate dynamic visual components based on user input, demonstrating its potential for various applications.
- Users need to set up an OpenAI API key and must have a minimum credit balance to use the service, which is relatively inexpensive.

Hey everyone, Zsolt here. I don't know when I was this excited the last time. Take a look at this! I took the code from Sahil Hood, who did a very similar solution for TL Draw, and I thought that this can be done with Excalidraw Automate. So I created the script this afternoon, and I want to show you how the script works. You can see here that already ChatGPT generated this clock based on my simple drawing and instructions. Now, let's see what happens if I press the buttons; in this case, the buttons don't quite stop the watch, but you can see that the clock is moving around. I had various rounds of experiments with this, and in some cases, this worked, in other cases, this didn't. So, let me show you a couple of the other attempts that I did. We can just simply go here and look at some of the other attempts. So let's say maybe page four; I think this one actually did work, so you can see that in this case, the generation worked. I've been playing with the script here and the instructions, and yeah, so it's a bit of practice, and the generation is not yet perfect, but in terms of functionality in Obsidian Excalidraw using Excalidraw Automate, I can recreate the same automation that was there in TL Draw using ChatGPT-4 and all the AI functionality now. If you want to play with this, it is already available in the script library, so all you need to do is come here to install or update Excalidraw scripts, and you need to type in "Draw a UI." Once you've typed this in, it will find Draw a UI here. You can just simply click, click here to install the script. After the script is installed, the first time you run the script, so when you install the script, then the robot will appear here, so you can see the downloaded script right here. The first time you run the script, you'll get this message that you need to add your OpenAI API key, and you need to run the script once because that‚Äôs when the settings are added to plugin settings. But if you come here to plugin settings, then you scroll down to the bottom of the Excalidraw settings, and here again, you scroll down to the very bottom, you will find the downloaded GPT Draw a UI script here, and you can set up your API key. You can get an API key from OpenAI; it's a pretty simple process. What you need to pay attention to is that you need to have at least $5 of credit on your account because the model that is being used in this case requires at least a tier one subscription. But overall, the price of this is not huge; you can see that today afternoon, as I was playing with this, I ran it a couple of times and was able to generate 15 cents of cost, so this is really peanuts. You can play with this for almost nothing, but you need to have at least $5 on your account. Now, in terms of the files that are generated, the script generates HTML files and it's going to by default place them in the GPT Playground folder, and those HTML files are then displayed here in the embeddable, so that‚Äôs just for you to know. You can clean up these HTML files if you want to clean up later on, or you can reuse them in your projects; that‚Äôs where the output goes. So again, as I said, I am super, super, super excited about this new development. I think it's awesome, and I'm just going to be playing with this all night, I think. But I wanted to share this with you so that you can play as well. Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/y3kHl_6Ll4w)
