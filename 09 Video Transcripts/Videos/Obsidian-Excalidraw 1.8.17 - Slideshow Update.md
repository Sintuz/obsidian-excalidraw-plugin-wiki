![Obsidian-Excalidraw 1.8.17 - Slideshow Update](https://youtu.be/mQ2eLk_0TV4)

# Summary
In this video, the speaker introduces improvements made to the slideshow feature in the Excalidraw plugin for Obsidian. New functionalities allow users to easily navigate between slides, edit content more efficiently, and hide the navigation arrows for a cleaner presentation view. These enhancements aim to streamline the user experience and make slide management more intuitive.

# Key Takeaways
- Users can now jump directly to any slide during a presentation using the slideshow actions window.
- The editing process has been improved, making it easier to manage slide elements without losing context.
- A new option allows users to hide navigation arrows after the slideshow, creating a cleaner visual for presentations.

Hey everyone! I'd like to quickly walk you through the improvements I've made to the slideshow script. So first of all, you need to click on the slideshow icon, and you need to select the line representing the slideshow sequence. Then you can press the forward arrow key, and you will be navigating through the slideshow now. One issue that I found was if I wanted to check how a slide looks at the end, I had to navigate through the entire slideshow one by one, and it was tedious, especially when it was a long slideshow. But now, if you press enter during your slideshow, then this slideshow actions window will pop up, and here you can select which slide you would like to navigate to, and immediately you're transported to that slide, allowing you to check how the slide looks. I also have an edit button here. So let me just show you the problem. If I want to edit a slide, I need to move these line points to fix it for that given slide, and it can be tedious, especially when you have different zoom levels on the same slide; it is hard to find which two dots to move, which represent the slide. So I have a solution for this as well. Now, if I double-click on the slideshow button, it will immediately open the slideshow in the slideshow actions mode, and here I can navigate to the slide that I want to edit. If I click edit, then you will see that the slide is zoomed out a little, and the two nodes representing this slide are actually highlighted. So I can move these, or I can just move them one by one, and it's pretty easy to find the ends of the line this way. [* ](https://youtu.be/mQ2eLk_0TV4?t=0)

Finally, the last improvement that I want to show you is again if I hit enter and I enter the slideshow actions, then here I can click to hide the navigation arrow after the slideshow. What this will do is if I turn this on and I end the presentation, then from now on, the lines are gone; they are not visible here. They are actually here, so if you would be able to right-click on it, then it's there, but it's logged in the background. Right now, if you have a hidden slideshow path in the background, you no longer need to select the arrow to start the presentation; you can just simply click on the presentation button, and the presentation will start. Now, if you enter the slideshow menu and you were to edit one of the slides, then when you click edit here, the line will be visible automatically again, and you can see the two points of this slide are selected, and I can easily move this around. I now know which lines I need to edit, and with this, I'm done editing this slide. If I want to hide the line again, I need to double-click the slideshow action, and I can just simply toggle this button here to hide my slideshow arrow, and that way the slideshow arrow is out of the way. I can easily edit my picture; I can embed it, and the lines depicting the direction of the slideshow will not clutter the view. [* ](https://youtu.be/mQ2eLk_0TV4?t=126)

So that's all I wanted to show you. You can update the script by going to the Excalidraw raw script library and scrolling down to the slideshow button. Here you'll have an update just like the organic line. I have not yet posted it, so you do not see the update available, but this is all you need to do. You need to install Excalidraw 1.8.17, which is the newest version, and you need to update your slideshow script, and you're ready to go. I hope you're going to enjoy this improved slideshow feature, and as always, please let me know what you think under this video in the comments. If you have a feature request or a bug report, then please report them on GitHub. Thank you! [* ](https://youtu.be/mQ2eLk_0TV4?t=245)
