Welcome to this introduction to Obsidian Excalidraw, where we will set up a template to enhance our visual note-taking experience.

First, we need to make sure that Excalidraw is installed in Obsidian. To do this, navigate to the community plugins section, where you can find and activate Excalidraw. Once installed, you will see how easy it is to create diagrams, sketches, and other visual elements that complement your traditional notes. [* ](https://youtu.be/oNPYZEpmuJ8?t=25)

Now, let’s set up our template. Start with creating a new Excalidraw file within Obsidian. Name it appropriately, such as "My Visual Template," and set up the initial structure. This could include placeholders for your ideas, drawings, and notes that you can fill in later. The flexibility of Excalidraw allows for a highly customizable design that works for your specific style of learning and note-taking. [* ](https://youtu.be/oNPYZEpmuJ8?t=55)

As we create our template, think about how you organize your thoughts visually. Incorporate shapes, arrows, and text boxes to represent concepts and their relationships. This visual arrangement can make it easier to recall information later, as visual cues often help in memory retention. [* ](https://youtu.be/oNPYZEpmuJ8?t=90)

Once your template is set up, experiment with different layouts and designs to find what works best for you. Don’t hesitate to update the template as you figure out the most effective ways to visualize your knowledge. Always remember that the goal is to enhance your personal knowledge management process by making it more engaging and visually appealing. [* ](https://youtu.be/oNPYZEpmuJ8?t=120)

Finally, save your template for future use and explore how to integrate other aspects of your notes with it. You can link your visual elements back to text notes within Obsidian, creating a cohesive PKM system that utilizes both visual and textual information. Enjoy your journey into visual PKM with Excalidraw! [* ](https://youtu.be/oNPYZEpmuJ8?t=150)
