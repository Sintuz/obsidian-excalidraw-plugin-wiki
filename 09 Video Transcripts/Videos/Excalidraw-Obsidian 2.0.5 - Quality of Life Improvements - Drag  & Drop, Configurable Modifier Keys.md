# Summary
In this video, Zsolt introduces the new features of Excalidraw version 2.0.5, focusing on performance improvements and enhanced drag-and-drop capabilities. He demonstrates how users can now import videos and images more interactively from both local drives and embedded links, as well as utilize configurable modifier key combinations. Additionally, the update includes limited support for animated GIFs, improving the overall user experience in visual note-taking.

# Key Takeaways
- Excalidraw 2.0.5 introduces performance improvements for smoother usage.
- Drag-and-drop functionality allows users to import videos and images interactively from local drives and vaults.
- Users can now configure modifier key combinations for link clicks and drag-and-drop actions, enhancing customization in the workflow.

Hey everyone, Zsolt here. Excalidraw 2.0.5 comes with four new improvements. First of all, I've worked on performance, and hopefully, you're going to feel this as you use Excalidraw as well as Obsidian. Excalidraw is now installed. [* ](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=0)

Secondly, I implemented some new drag-and-drop actions, particularly focusing on dragging and dropping from your local hard drive. For example, now you will be able to drag and drop videos from your local hard drive, and they're going to be interactive in Excalidraw. You'll also be able to drag and drop from folders within your Vault using your native File Explorer. For instance, dropping images into Excalidraw will be intelligent and will recognize that those files come from your vault. [* ](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=4)

Thirdly, I implemented configurable modifier key combinations for the different drag-and-drop actions, as well as for the link-click actions. Finally, I implemented limited support for animated GIFs. It's limited because on the canvas, you will see the GIF animated, and it looks nice, but when you export this as an image, this animated GIF is going to be a gray box because this is really an embeddable object, not an image. Nonetheless, I think it looks cool, and if you use Excalidraw as a canvas‚Äînot as printed material‚Äîthen this is going to work great for you. [* ](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=10)

So let's dive in and first look at the drag-and-drop actions, and then let's look at the modifier key combinations and the GIFs. So let's start with the drag-and-drop actions. Here, for example, on my local drive, in my downloads folder, I have this demo MP4 file. If I drag and drop this into Excalidraw, then you can see that the video was imported, and it's actually an interactive file. You can see that it's animated. I can also open this to interact with it, to stop it, and from now on this video is on my canvas. [* ](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=18)

Similarly, I can come to a web page, and this is where my dancing figure came from, and I can drag and drop my figure in here. Here, I need to change the option, so the default action is to insert an image. If I do this first, then this is going to insert the image itself; however, this will be a static image. If you want an interactive image, you need to embed it as an embeddable. You have two options: one is to drag and drop the file from the browser to here and press the modifier key combination. On Windows, the default is Control + Shift to insert it in an interactive frame. When I do so, then the frame is inserted and you need to slightly resize it to get rid of the black box. Unfortunately, as far as I can see, that black area around the image comes from the operating system; I didn't find a way to get rid of that. But if you resize the box, then it actually looks fine. [* ](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=35)

Now, let's look at what happens when I drag and drop a file from the Vault path on my local drive. Here, I'm going to right-click on this skating GIF and open this in my system explorer. You can see that this is where my vault is; this is in the vault root. Now if I take this skater and drop the file here, again, I know this is actually an interactive image. So this is an animated GIF. I'm going to again press Control + Shift to insert an interactive frame, and with this, I inserted my skater. The important thing is you can see that Excalidraw recognized that this skater was already in my vault, so it added an internal link and not an external link. So you can see the skating GIF was added. [* ](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=60)

So these are the two major changes with drag-and-drop. Now let's look at the modifier key combinations. In the README, you will find this file; these are the default settings for the modifier keys. There are many different types of modifier key combinations. The first one is to open a link; this could be clicking on an Excalidraw drawing in a markdown file or clicking on a link within an Excalidraw drawing. You can see the different options you have here. You can drag and drop from a web browser, from the Obsidian file explorer, and finally from your local operating system. I think this is actually a pretty daunting list of combinations because using Shift, Control, Alt, and Meta (or Shift, Command, Option, and Control) allows for various combinations. I understand people have different preferences regarding what should be the default action and what combination should do what. [* ](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=88)

Finally, I made this configurable. So how does this work? If you go to the Excalidraw plugin settings, you need to click here on Excalidraw, and under Excalidraw Appearance and Behavior, if you open this group at the bottom, you will see link-click and drag-and-drop modifier keys. Here, you can modify these four categories. For example, if I want to change the link-click behavior, I want the documents to open in a new tab by default and not open in the active window. Then I can actually click here. If you hover over these buttons, I explain it up here that the sequence of these struggles are Shift, Control, Alt, and Meta. If you open this on a Mac, then you will see the relevant sequence for the Mac, which I think goes Shift, Option, Command, and Control. You need to read the text, and I also added tool tips here. If you hover over these buttons, you will get the feedback. Now you can see that I was able to set the same combination for both of them; this is not good because only one of them will happen. I cannot predict which one will be honored. So as you do your settings, you need to ensure that within the group, everything is set in a unique way. [* ](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=293)

Right now, I want to make the single click open in a new tab and the Control click to be the one that opens in the currently active window. So if I now close settings, I‚Äôm going to come back to my untitled document. You can see here that these images that were dropped from Obsidian don‚Äôt work. The one that was actually dropped from the local drive does appear here as well. Nonetheless, what I want to show you right now is if I long click on this image, it opens in a new tab because that was the configuration we made, which was that the default action of long clicking should be in a new tab. Now if I hold down the Control key and long click, it will open in the same tab. So you can see that I can change these settings now. [* ](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=464)

Also, pay attention that when you look at these settings, you will see a small text that in case none of the combinations apply, the default action for this group is to open a new tab. Why is this important? In this case, right now, because I changed the combination, if I open my demo image and Control click on this link, it will open in the same window because that's the configuration I've given now and I've lost my capability to open it in a new tab. Now of course you could set up your dedicated combination for that, but because Control + Shift is not defined, pressing Control + Shift will invoke the default Behavior. So if I press Control + Shift in this case, it will open in a new window. I hope that the default settings are actually good, so I would think that you will only change this if something is really not working for you with the default settings. Now with these settings, you have more flexibility in configuring how Excalidraw works for you. [* ](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=563)

So I hope you find these new features valuable, and as always, I'm available in discussions on Discord and all the other forums. I‚Äôm happy to hear your feedback, discuss feature requests, and overall, I'm eager to learn how you're using Excalidraw. Thank you! [* ](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=611)

[going to be intelligent and will](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=51) [recognize that those files come from](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=53) [your](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=55) [wult thirdly I imp implemented](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=57) [configurable modifier key combinations](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=60) [for the different drag and drop actions](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=63) [as well as for the link click](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=66) [actions and finally I implemented](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=69) [limited support for animated gifs it's](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=73) [limited because on the canvas you will](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=77) [see the JF animated and it looks nice](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=79) [but when you export this as an image](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=84) [this animated gif is going to be a gray](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=86) [box because this is really an embeddable](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=89) [object not an image nonetheless I think](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=92) [it looks cool and if you use excal draw](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=96) [as a canvas not as a printed material](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=99) [then this is going to work great for you](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=103) [so let's dive in and let's first look at](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=105) [drag and drop actions and then let's](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=108) [look at the modifier key

and](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=122) [drop this into exol draw then you can](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=127) [see that the video was imported and it's](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=130) [actually an interactive file you can see](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=133) [it's animated I can also open this to](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=136) [interact with it to stop it and from now](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=140) [on this video is on my](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=143) [canvas similarly I can Al come to a web](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=147) [page so this is where my dancing figure](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=150) [came from and I can drag and drop my](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=153) [figure in here here I need to change

the](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=187) [default is control shift to insert it in](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=190) [an interactive frame and when I do so](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=193) [then the frame is inserted and you need](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=197) [to slightly resize it to get rid of the](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=200) [Black Box unfortunately as far as I can](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=203) [see that black area around the image](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=205) [comes from the operating system I didn't](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=209) [find a way to get rid of that but if you](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=211) [resize the box then it actually looks](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=214) [fine so now let's look at what happens](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=217) [when I drag and drop a file from The](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=220) [Vault path on my loal drive so here I'm](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=223) [going to right click on this skating GIF](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=227) [and I'm going to open this in my system](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=231) [Explorer so this is in my system](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=234) [Explorer you can see that this is on the](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=237) [p where my vault is this is in the vault](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=239) [route now if I take this skater and drop](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=242) [the file here again I know this is](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=246) [actually an interactive image so this is](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=249) [an animated gif I'm going to again press](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=252) [control shift to insert an interactive](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=255) [frame and with this I inserted my](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=258) [skater but I think the important thing](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=262) [is you can see that exol recognized that](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=265) [this skater was already in my Vault so](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=270) [it added an internal link and not an](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=273) [external link so you can see there](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=276) [skating the GIF was added so these are](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=278) [the two major changes with dragon drop](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=282) [now let's look at the modifier key](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=285) [combinations in the read me you find](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=288) [this file these are the default settings](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=290) [for the modifier keys and you can see](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=293) [that there are many different type of](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=296) [modifier key comp combinations or](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=298) [options the first one is to open a link](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=300) [this could be clicking on an exol R](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=304) [drawing in a markdown file or clicking](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=306) [on a link within an exol drawing and you](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=310) [can see the different options you have](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=313) [here then you can drag and drop from a](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=315) [web browser you can also drag and drop](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=319) [from the obsidian file explorer and](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=322) [finally you can drag and drop from your](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=325) [local operating system and you can see I](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=328) [think this is actually a pretty daunting](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=332) [list of combinations because using shift](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=334) [control alt and meta or shift command](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=338) [option and control you can have various](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=341) [combinations and I understand people](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=345) [have different preferences as for what](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=347) [should be the default action and what](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=350) [combination should do what so finally I](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=353) [made this configurable so how does this](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=356) [work if you go to excal draw plugin](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=360) [settings you need to click here on exol](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=363) [draw and under exro appearance and](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=365) [behavior if you open this group at the](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=369) [bottom you will see link click and drag](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=372) [and drop modifier keys and here you can](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=376) [modify these four categories for example](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=380) [if I want to change the link click](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=384) [Behavior I want](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=388) [the documents to open in a new tab by](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=390) [default and not open in the active](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=393) [window then I can actually click here so](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=396) [if you hover these buttons but also I](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=399) [explain it up here that the sequence of](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=402) [these struggles are shift control alt](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=405) [and](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=407) [meta if you open this on a Mac then you](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=408) [will see the relevant sequence for the](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=411) [Mac I think it goes shift option command](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=414) [and control but you need to read the](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=418) [text and also I added tool tips here so](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=421) [if you hover these buttons then you will](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=424) [get the feedback now you can see that](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=427) [here I was able to set the same](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=430) [combination for both of them this is not](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=432) [good only one of them will happen I](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=435) [cannot predict which one will be honored](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=437) [so as you do your settings you need to](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=439) [make sure that within the group](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=442) [everything is set in a unique way so](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=444) [right now I wanted to make the single](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=448) [click to be open in a new tab and the](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=451) [control click to be the one to open in](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=454) [the current active window so if I now](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=458) [close settings I'm going to come back to](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=461) [my Untitled document so you can see](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=464) [here that uh these images that were](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=468) [dropped from obsidian don't work the one](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=472) [actually that was dropped from the local](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=474) [Drive does appear here as well](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=477) [nonetheless what I want to show you](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=481) [right now is if I longclick on this](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=483) [image then it opens in a new tab because](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=487) [that was the configuration that we made](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=491) [that the default action of long clicking](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=494) [should be in a new tab and if I now hold](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=496) [down the control key and long click then](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=499) [it will open in the same tab so you can](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=502) [see that I can change these settings now](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=505) [also pay attention that here when you](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=509) [look at these settings you will also see](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=512) [here a small text that in case of none](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=516) [of the combinations apply the default](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=519) [action for this group is open a new tab](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=522) [why is this important in this case](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=526) [because right now because I changed the](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=528) [combination if I](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=532) [open my demo image and I control click](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=535) [for example on this link here then it's](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=540) [going to open in the same window because](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=543) [that's the configuration I've given now](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=546) [and I've lost my capability to open it](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=549) [in a new tab now of course you could set](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=552) [up your dedicated combination for that](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=554) [but because control shift is not defined](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=558) [so if I press control shift that is](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=561) [going to invoke the default Behavior so](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=564) [if I press control Shi shift on this in](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=567) [this case it's going to open in a new](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=570) [window I hope that the default settings](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=574) [are actually good so I would think that](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=577) [you will only change this if something](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=580) [is really not working for you with the](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=583) [default settings and now with these](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=585) [settings you have more flexibility in](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=587) [configuring how exol drop works for you](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=590) [so I hope you find these new features](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=594) [valuable and as always in the](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=597) [discussions on Discord and on all the](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=600) [other forums where I'm available happy](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=603) [to hear your feedback happy to discuss](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=605) [feature requests and overall happy to](https://youtu.be/kp1K7GRrE6E?t=608)
