![Colorful Second Brain - Part 3: Simple rules for beautiful and reusable sketches](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt discusses the importance of simple rules in creating beautiful and reusable sketches as part of his series on Visual Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) using Obsidian Excalidraw. He covers key concepts such as color usage, typography, and how these elements contribute to the overall effectiveness and reusability of sketches. By establishing consistent guidelines for colors and text, viewers can enhance the clarity and aesthetic appeal of their visual notes.

# Key Takeaways
- Simple rules in design not only enhance aesthetics but also improve reusability of sketches.
- Employing a three-color technique can create effective color schemes and maintain clarity within drawings.
- Consistent typography standards help size elements properly and improve the coherence of visual content.

# Content
Hey everyone and welcome to part three in my mini-series, Colorful Second Brain. Today we are going to talk about simple rules for beautiful and reusable sketches. This episode is going to build on things that we've learned in part two and in part one, so if something is unclear, feel free to go back and re-watch part two or part one or to ask me a question in the comments, and I'm going to be happy to help. [* ](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=0)

I want to cover three topics today. First, we are going to talk about how having simple rules is more than just about aesthetics; it’s also about reusability. Then we're going to talk about some basic approaches and rules for using colors and how you can keep it simple. Third, we're going to look at typography and how being clever about text and text sizing can help you with reusability as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=31)

The consistent use of colors and typography is the foundation of reusability. Why do I say that? If you take a look at my stencil library, you will see that I have different color schemes here. Up here, you can see my new color scheme that I've also used, for example, in my book on a page, and I plan to use it in the future. Below that, you will see that in my stencil library, I have all sorts of different colors. I had a period where I had only black and white items, but I also have many different colors. This is all mashed up now. If I want to use an icon from here— for example, if I want to use this brain icon from here— I can drop it in here. That's great, but then if I look at this entire drawing, it just doesn't look as good as it could with this color scheme. Had I been more clever about this, then this brain would fit this drawing much better. Also, you can see that this brain here is large. Now, of course, I can change the size of this to make it smaller, and in this case, I'm lucky because the sizing was close to correct. But if I were to make it smaller and smaller, then suddenly you can see that the thickness of the lines, as well as the sloppiness of the lines, becomes a problem. This brain doesn't look as good and small. Now, of course, I could go in and start to change some of the settings and try to make it look better, but then this is going to add friction to my process. I cannot just simply reuse this item in my drawing. If I have a couple of simple rules that I adhere to, which will result in a similarly sized drawing— because the text will set the size— and similar palettes or similar colors because of a common palette, then reusability is going to be a much easier topic. [* ](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=65)

Second, if you're clever about applying colors, it can add contrast to your page, and it is going to make it easier for you or for someone else to interpret whatever is on the page. It just makes it easier to read because you know what's important versus what's supporting text. You can easily find drawings. Also, by having colors and a simple color scheme, it can help you in assessing if you have a drawing that is too heavy on image or on text, and it can help you create balanced sketches, which not only means aesthetically balanced but also balanced content-wise. This means you have enough explanation but you don't have too much explanation. You have enough imagery, but it's not too high-level such that you will not remember it later on. You will be able to see this at a glance because the color composition and the balance of your drawing will reflect the content composition of your drawing as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=200)

And third, colors help structure the note-taking process, and this is what we're going to look at in the next part. So, if you consistently apply a color approach, that is going to drive a process that will shape your thinking as well. In a way, this is also a tool for thought; this is a graphical tool for thought. [* ](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=274)

Under colors, I'm going to talk about three different approaches I recommend starting with. If you're new to sketchnoting, new to sketchnoting in Obsidian with Excalidraw, I recommend keeping it simple. There are lots of colors to choose from; I recommend keeping it simple. It's going to look better, and also it's going to be more reusable in the end. The three-color technique is something I learned from Doug Neal from "Verbal to Visual." I'm going to leave a link to his video in the description; he explains it probably better than I do, but I'm going to add some Obsidian-specific items as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=304)

The point in the three-color technique is that you have three colors: one color for the imagery, a second color which is your primary text color, and a third color, a gray color, which is a helper color that you can use for secondary text as well as supporting imagery like arrows and clouds and things like that. Having a third color—having a gray—is immensely useful because there’s lots of secondary stuff you want to put on a drawing. If everything is vivid, it makes the drawing hard to read, and for that reason, having a gray in your palette is super useful. I do recommend doing that when you're choosing your colors. In the three-color technique, I recommend choosing vivid or strong colors for your imagery and for your primary text and something lighter for your gray. It doesn't need to be gray, as you will see in this next approach. [* ](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=330)

The next approach is the single color palette, which is a monochromatic palette; you only use a single color, but you use different shades of that color. In this case, my secondary text is a lighter version of the primary color, and you can see that even with a monochromatic scale, you can create colorful-looking objects. Using a single monochromatic palette will ensure that your drawings are not visually overwhelming; it will just look simpler and nicer. [* ](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=420)

If nonetheless, you want to use multiple colors, then here are a couple of best practices to keep in mind. First of all, you should choose an accent color, and that is my first row right here. The rest of the colors should be dimmer. Back to my book on a page on deep work, you will see that I have a warm background color; this is my base color, and my accent color right here is a bit more vivid. All together, in this palette, I have ten colors in total, or if we count the blacks and the grays, then 15 colors in total, and I think the end result looks pretty nice and balanced. [* ](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=468)

Now, if you need more colors and two colors are not enough, you can have a palette with four colors that will give you more flexibility. But, in this case, as well, the recommendation is to try to keep your accent color vibrant and the rest of the colors a bit more dim. [* ](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=516)

In terms of color management, I recommend standardizing the structure of your palettes. In part two, we talked about the paletin.com tool and how you can create palettes. I recommend making sure that your palette files look a standard way. The approach we looked at last time was using this JSON format, though I also showed you this text-based format. The way I enhanced the palette loader in the meantime is now you can add comments in between your palettes, and the reason for this is I realized that, for example, I have this blue vibrant palette here. Now, if I want to change this, that is extremely difficult because I'm not able to go back to paletin to change this, because I don't know the settings I had. So for this reason, now you can add comments into your palette, and those comments can be links. If I click on this link, it’s going to take me to Pelatin, and here I can see my palette. This is the vivid red color, and if I come back here and click on the other link, then this is going to be the less vibrant other three colors that I use from here. The way you export this is you come to tables, export, click on text, and you get this text format output. If I only want the three secondary colors from here, then I can copy the three colors, open Notepad++, paste it in here, in Notepad++, if I hold down Alt+Shift, then I can select an area like this, and with this, in a couple of clicks, I can format this data set such that it looks in my palette file. So you can see I have my three secondary colors like this, and this is what I had right here. Also, just a point on how you can use Paletin for setting up these colors. So if I come back here, this is my vivid red, and if I want to now define my dimmer secondary colors, I can click here on fine-tune, and I can start to decrease the saturation of the color. I can also increase the brightness of the color and decrease the contrast, and with this, I can come to a color palette for my dimmer colors that I enjoy. The more I remove the saturation, the more it will move to the gray area. [* ](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=539)

So, back to our discussion. When you look at your palette, I recommend making sure that the sequence of your colors is the same. Here in my two-palette setup, I am actually not using the recommendation I have here. I'm doing it exactly the opposite way. In this case, in my palette, I have my accent color second and my pastel or dimmer color first. I actually recommend switching this around because that is how I'm doing it for my vibrant colors, and this is the learning. So you need to think through how you want to structure your palette and always do that. I recommend putting the vibrant colors first and then the dimmer ones. If you're clever about your palettes, then you can use the palette switcher to switch between palettes. So here, I'm going to switch from my warm palette to my cool palette, and I'm going to ask Excalidraw to try to repaint. You can see that with a single switch, I moved my drawing from the previous warm palette to a cool palette. Here, my accent color is the orange, and my base color is this greenish-blue color. You can have your opinion about whether this looks nice or not; the point I'm trying to get across is that if you're clever about how you apply your palette, you will be able to display your drawing with different palettes, and it will help you with reusability because there are situations where you want to use one or the other color scheme, and this way, with a simple click, you can switch between the different palettes, and your drawing will still look nice and coherent because the colors within the palette will work out nicely with each other. [* ](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=847)

Also, creating a single ballot for yourself may require multiple settings in Paletin, and that is what we did here, where I loaded my vibrant color and then fine-tuned the color, which resulted in this dimmer palette. Then I exported this, and these are the second, third, and fourth colors in my palette. Here you can see the result that this palette comes from two different palettes and settings. [* ](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=882)

Finally, let's talk a little about text. I don't want to dwell too much on this, but I've learned that having a standard for text sizing and actually using the standards in Excalidraw— you can see here that for text, you have small, medium, large, and extra-large text. Using these consistently will help you size your images right, so the text in itself looks good when you're zoomed out 200 percent; it looks readable. If the drawings match the size of your text, that is just simply going to be super helpful because then if you copy a piece of drawing from one drawing to another or from your stencil library into your drawing, it's just going to look better than if they follow a standard sizing. [* ](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=940)

Now, how you want to apply and what rules you want is in my mind. The title of the document—that is something custom. So, coming back here, you will see that these here on the side are custom-sized text. But then my section headings— you can see here, and the rest of the tags— they follow a standard now. The gray that I'm using here is not a very light gray, so therefore maybe the gray and the black don't show such a strong contrast. But I am consistently using grays and blacks here, as well as heading text and section headers, etc. I think this approach helps you be more consistent. [* ](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=991)

If you're wondering how I created this title, this was extremely simple, but I'll show you. So this is my title text; I'm going to make a copy of the title, and I'm going to zoom in. In this case, I have a copy of the title text with a different color, and voila! I have this nice shadowing background to the text, which if I group and enlarge, then I can simply create this more fancy-looking shadow text in Excalidraw. [* ](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1014)

So to summarize, we looked at three things today. We looked at how simple rules are more than just about aesthetics; they are about reusability as well and process and repeatability. We looked at different color schemes; I recommend starting with the three-color technique. You can choose three different colors, but pay attention that the first two should be strong colors, and the last one should be a lighter color. I think a monochromatic palette can be beautiful, so I do recommend experimenting with that. If you want multiple colors, then I recommend having a color that is strong and vivid, and the rest should be dimmer; otherwise, your sketch will just look visually overwhelming. Finally, if you establish a couple of simple rules for typography, that is going to help you in reusability as well because the different components that you might be reusing in a drawing will have similar sizes, and the text on those components will also look similar, and you'll not need to spend time constantly resizing. [* ](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1104)

So getting back to the Colorful Second Brain storyline, next time I will go into a bit more technical details about how you can program color in Excalidraw. As you might remember from part one, I added a library called Color Master, and that gives you lots of power over how you manage colors and how you can create color palettes automatically in Excalidraw. I think there are some cool use cases that I want to show you. From here, I thought we will move on to talking about the use of colors across your Obsidian vault, and I'm still unsure what exactly the mystery topic is going to be, but I have a couple of ideas, so we will see. If there's interest, I'm sure I'm going to create a sixth video here as well on the topic of color. Thank you for watching until the end, and I hope to see you next time.

much](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=249) [explanation you have enough image but](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=252) [it's not too high level such that you](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=254) [will not remember later on and you will](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=256) [be able to see this at a glance because](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=259) [the color composition and the balance of](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=263) [your drawing is going to reflect the](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=266) [content composition of your drawing as](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=270) [well](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=273) [and third colors help structure the](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=274) [note-taking process and this is what](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=278) [we're going to look at in the next piece](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=280) [so if you consistently apply a color](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=284) [approach that is going to also drive a](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=287) [process which will shape your thinking](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=291) [as well in a way this is also a tool for](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=293) [thought this is a graphical tool for](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=297) [thought](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=299) [so under colors I'm going to talk about](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=302) [three different approaches I recommend](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=304) [starting here so if you're new to](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=307) [sketchnoting new to sketchnuting in](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=311) [obsidian with X collateral I recommend](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=314) [keeping it simple there are lots of](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=316) [colors to choose from I recommend](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=319) [keeping it simple it's going to look](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=321) [better and also it's going to be more](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=324) [reusable in the end](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=328) [the three color technique is something I](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=330) [learned from dog Neil from verbal to](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=333) [visual I'm going to leave a link to his](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=336) [video in the description he explains it](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=339) [probably better than I do but I'm going](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=343) [to add some obsidian specific items as](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=345) [well](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=348) [so the point in the three color](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=349) [technique is you have three colors you](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=351) [have one color for the imagery you have](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=353) [a second color which is your primary](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=356) [text color and you have a third color a](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=359) [gray color which is a helper color that](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=363) [you can use for secondary text as well](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=366) [as supporting imagery like arrows and](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=370) [clouds and things like that](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=373) [having a third color having a gray is](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=376) [immensely useful because there's lots of](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=380) [secondary stuff you want to put on a](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=384) [drawing if everything is vivid it makes](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=386) [the drawing hard to read and for that](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=389) [reason having a gray in your palette is](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=393) [super useful and I do recommend doing](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=396) [that when you're choosing your colors in](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=399) [the three color technique I recommend](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=402) [choosing Vivid or strong colors for your](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=404) [imagery and for your primary text and](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=408) [something lighter for your gray it](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=412) [doesn't need to be gray as you will see](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=416) [in this next approach](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=418) [and the next approach is the single](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=420) [color palette which is a monochromatic](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=423) [palette you only use a single color but](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=425) [you use different shades of that color](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=429) [in this case my secondary text is a](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=431) [lighter version of the primary color and](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=435) [you can see that even with a](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=439) [monochromatic scale you can create](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=442) [colorful looking objects using a single](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=444) [monochromatic palette will ensure that](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=449) [your drawings are not visually](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=452) [overwhelming it will just look simpler](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=454) [and nicer](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=457) [if nonetheless you want to use multiple](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=460) [colors then here are a couple of best](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=463) [practices to keep in mind](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=465) [first of all you should choose an accent](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=468) [color and that is my first row right](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=471) [here and then the rest of the colors](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=474) [should be dimmer back to my book on a](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=477) [page on deep work you will see that I](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=480) [have a warm background color this is my](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=484) [base color and my accent color right](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=488) [here](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=492) [is a bit more Vivid and all together in](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=492) [this palette I have 10 colors in total](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=497) [or if we count the blacks and the Grays](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=501) [then 15 colors in total and I think the](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=503) [end result looks pretty nice and](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=507) [balanced](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=510) [now if you need more colors and two](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=512) [colors are not enough you can have a](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=516) [palette with four colors that will give](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=519) [you more flexibility but in this case as](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=522) [well the recommendation is try to keep](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=525) [your accent color vibrant and the rest](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=528) [of the colors a bit more dim](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=533) [in terms of color management](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=536) [I recommend standardizing the structure](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=539) [of your palettes in part two we talked](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=543) [about the paletin.com tool and how you](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=545) [can create palettes I recommend making](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=549) [sure that your palette files look a](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=553) [standard way the approach we looked at](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=556) [the last time was using this Json format](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=558) [though I also showed you this text based](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=563) [format the way I enhanced palette loader](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=566) [in the meantime is now you can add](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=570) [comments in between your palettes and](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=572) [the reason for this is I realized that](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=576) [for example I have this blue vibrant](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=578) [palette here](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=580) [now if I want to change this that is](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=581) [extremely difficult because I'm not able](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=585) [to go back to paletin to change this](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=587) [because I don't know the settings I had](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=590) [so for this reason now you can add](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=592) [comments into your palette and those](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=595) [comments can be links and if I click on](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=599) [this link then this is going to take me](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=602) [to Peloton and here I can see my palette](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=605) [this is the Vivid red color and if I](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=609) [come back here and click on the other](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=612) [link then this is going to be the less](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=613) [Vibe brand other three colors that I use](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=618) [from here and the way you export this is](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=621) [you come to tables export click on text](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=624) [and you get this text format output if I](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=628) [only want the three secondary colors](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=631) [from here then I can copy the three](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=634) [colors I can open notepad plus plus](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=636) [paste it in here in notepad plus plus if](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=639) [I hold down alt shift then I can select](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=643) [an area like this and with this in](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=647) [couple of clicks I can format this data](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=650) [set such as it looks in my palette file](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=655) [so you can see I have my three secondary](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=660) [colors like this and this is what I had](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=663) [right here also just a point on how you](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=667) [can use paletin for setting up these](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=672) [colors so if I come back here](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=675) [this is my Vivid red and if I want to](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=679) [now Define my dimmer secondary colors I](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=683) [can click here on fine tune and I can](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=687) [start to decrease the saturation of the](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=690) [color I can also increase the brightness](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=693) [of the color and decrease the contrast](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=696) [and with this I can come to a color](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=700) [palette for my dimmer colors that I](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=704) [enjoy the more I remove the saturation](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=708) [the more it will move to the gray area](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=710) [so back to our discussion when you look](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=714) [at your palette I recommend making sure](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=718) [that the sequence of your colors is the](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=721) [same so here in my two palette setup I](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=724) [actually am not using the recommendation](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=730) [I have here I'm doing it exactly the](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=732) [opposite way so in this case in my](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=735) [palette I have my](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=738) [accent color second and my postel or](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=741) [dimmer color first I actually recommend](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=745) [switching this around because that is](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=749) [how I'm doing it for my vibrant colors](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=752) [and this is the learning so you need to](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=756) [think through how you want to structure](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=758) [your palette and always do that I](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=760) [recommend putting the vibrant colors](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=763) [first and then the dimmer ones and if](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=765) [you're clever about your palettes then](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=769) [you can use the palette switcher to](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=772) [switch between palette so here I'm going](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=775) [to switch from this is the my palette](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=777) [warm I'm going to switch to the cool](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=780) [palette and I'm going to ask that](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=783) [x-collegal does try to repaint and you](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=786) [can see that with a single switch I](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=789) [moved my drawing from the previous a](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=792) [warm palette to a cool palette here my](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=795) [accent color is the orange](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=798) [and my base color is this greenish blue](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=801) [color](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=804) [you can have your opinion whether this](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=805) [looks nice or not the point what I'm](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=808) [trying to get across is that if you're](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=810) [clever about how you apply your palette](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=813) [you will be able to display your drawing](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=816) [with different palettes and it will help](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=820) [you with reusability because there are](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=822) [situations where you want to use one or](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=825) [the other color scheme and this way with](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=828) [a simple click you can switch between](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=831) [the different palettes and your drawing](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=834) [will still look nice and coherent](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=837) [because the colors within the palette](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=840) [will work out nicely with each other](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=844) [also creating a single ballot for](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=847) [yourself may require multiple settings](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=850) [in palatin and that is what we did here](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=853) [where I loaded my vibrant color and then](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=857) [I changed fine-tuned the color which](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=861) [resulted in this dimmer palette and then](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=864) [I exported this and these are the second](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=868) [third and fourth colors in my palette](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=871) [and here you can see the result that](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=874) [this palette comes from two different](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=877) [palette and settings](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=879) [and finally let's talk a little about](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=882) [text I don't want to dwell too much on](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=885) [this but I've learned that having a](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=888) [standard for text sizing and actually](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=892) [using the standards in excalator so you](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=894) [can see here that for text you have](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=899) [small medium large and extra large text](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=901) [using these consistently will help you](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=905) [size your images right so the text in](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=909) [itself looks good when you're zoomed out](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=912) [200 percent it looks readable](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=916) [and if the drawings match the size of](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=919) [your attacks that is just simply going](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=922) [to be super helpful because then if you](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=925) [copy a piece of drawing from one drawing](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=927) [to another or from your stencil Library](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=931) [into your drawing it's just going to](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=933) [look better than it follows a standard](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=936) [sizing now how you want to apply and](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=940) [what rules you want in my mind the title](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=943) [of the document that is something custom](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=946) [so coming back here you will see that](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=950) [these here on the side these are custom](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=953) [sized text but then my section headings](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=956) [you can see here and the rest of the](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=960) [tags they follow a standard now the](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=962) [grade that I'm using here is not a very](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=965) [light gray so therefore maybe the gray](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=968) [and the black you don't see such a](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=971) [strong contrast but I am consistently](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=974) [using Grays and blacks here as well as](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=977) [well as heading text and section headers](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=981) [Etc I think this approach helps you with](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=985) [being more consistent now if you're](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=989) [wondering how I created this title this](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=991) [was extremely simple but I'll show you](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=994) [so this is my title text I'm going to](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=997) [make a copy of title I'm going to zoom](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1000) [in in this case and I have a copy of the](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1003) [title text with a different color and](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1007) [voila I have this nice shadowing](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1010) [background to the text which if I group](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1014) [and enlarge then I can simply create](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1016) [this more fancy looking Shadow text in X](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1020) [collateral](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1025) [so to summarize](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1027) [we looked at three things today we](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1029) [looked at how simple rules are more than](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1032) [just about the Statics they are about](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1035) [reusability as well and process and](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1037) [repeatability we looked at different](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1041) [color schemes I recommend starting with](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1044) [the three color technique you can choose](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1047) [three different colors but pay attention](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1050) [that the first two should be strong](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1052) [colors and the last one should be a](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1055) [lighter color](https://youtu.be/r9oB1SlK1GU?t=1057) [I think a monochromatic
