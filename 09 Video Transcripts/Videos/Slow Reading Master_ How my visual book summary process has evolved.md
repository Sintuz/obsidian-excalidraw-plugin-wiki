Hey, I'm Zsolt. Welcome to Visual PKM as we dive into Rick Rubin's "The Creative Act". In cohort 9 of the Visual Thinking Workshop, I've been reflecting on how my approach to creating visual book summaries has evolved over the years. This video will give you a brief overview of my current process. [* ](https://youtu.be/E2zzYE9IrnU?t=0)

First off, if you define productivity as reading many books quickly, my process is likely not for you. But if you enjoy immersing yourself in a book and spending 6 to 8 weeks doing research, illustration, linking, thinking, and processing, then you might find my experiences useful. My approach has its roots in Thiago Forte's Progressive Summarization, but it's changed so much that it might be hard to see the similarities now. [* ](https://youtu.be/E2zzYE9IrnU?t=26)

Thiago's method balances compression with maintaining context, aiming to create a short, searchable summary that still holds enough context to remind you of key points years later. It's a simple, iterative process that you can execute in short chunks over time, converting a full book into a meaningful mini summary. Thiago defines five layers of summarization: first, highlight key points in the original text and add short notes; second, import your highlights and go through them, marking standout phrases; third, review your highlights and bold the most critical words; fourth, create a summary that encapsulates the book's core ideas; and finally, remix the content into a new format like a blog post. [* ](https://youtu.be/E2zzYE9IrnU?t=47)

However, I found Thiago's approach a bit too sequential and mechanical. Often, by the time I engage with my book clippings and notes, they no longer resonate. Also, sitting and reading for hours can get monotonous. So, I adopted a more iterative process inspired by "How to Read a Paragraph" by Richard Paul and Linda Elder and insights from Doug Neil from verbal to visual. [* ](https://youtu.be/E2zzYE9IrnU?t=119)

I start by engaging with the book even before reading it, looking for an interview with the author, listening to the interview, and creating a mind map summary of the key points. This helps me understand the person behind the book. It transforms the text into more of a conversation and aids in mapping out the primary ideas, giving context to what I read. I capture my interview notes and map the primary ideas on my idea integration board for the book. [* ](https://youtu.be/E2zzYE9IrnU?t=133)

I then read the book chapter by chapter, importing my highlights and annotations into Obsidian. After each section, instead of dumping all my notes into a single file, I create a new file for each chapter or section. This segmentation makes the process more manageable and helps maintain context. It also assists with visualizing my links in Excalibrain since I have more targeted links per chapter. [* ](https://youtu.be/E2zzYE9IrnU?t=180)

Before moving on with the book, I review my highlights and create illustrations for each section. My goal is to read and process in chunks, adding a single summary visual to each imported section. On one side of the note, I have my literature notes for the section, and on the other, the visual summary. As I go through my chapter highlights, I connect those notes with other ideas in my vault using Nick Milo's Noma method and my ontology from Excalibrain, following Vicky Z's idea Compass. [* ](https://youtu.be/E2zzYE9IrnU?t=205)

Noma stands for note-making and consists of four steps: first, be a think-finder; notice when you think, "Hmm, that's interesting." Second, be a link-finder and ask yourself, "This idea reminds me of...". Third, be an active thinker; spot the differences and note down similarities and differences. Finally, understand the importance and complete the sentence: "It's important because...". [* ](https://youtu.be/E2zzYE9IrnU?t=251)

The Noma method is supercharged by the idea Compass based on your ontology for the links. The idea Compass adds a spatial context to your connections in Excalidraw. To the north are the origins, the parent ideas; to the south are the next level ideas and examples; to the west are similar ideas; and to the east are ideas that oppose or supercharge the idea you're exploring. [* ](https://youtu.be/E2zzYE9IrnU?t=290)

Once I finish reading the book, I end up with a collection of visuals. My final step is to compile these into a "book on a page" summary. This summary tells my story of the book: what was important to me, how I connected it to other notes, and how I'm applying it. For example, as I read "The Creative Act," I can't help but notice how many of Rubin's concepts tie into my previous notes on creative processes, productivity, innovation, and even negotiation tactics and philosophy. [* ](https://youtu.be/E2zzYE9IrnU?t=318)

My book-on-a-page is similar to Thiago's mini-summary, where remixing occurs by reusing visual elements from earlier illustrations, linking concepts through visuals. For instance, in my illustration for "Breaking Sameness," I reused visuals from the "Periodic Table of Productivity" and "Deep Work," creating a cohesive and interconnected understanding of these concepts. [* ](https://youtu.be/E2zzYE9IrnU?t=360)

With each book I look at, my approach evolves, and I know it will continue to do so. I like my current method because it keeps me in constant dialogue with the book. I get more connections to my existing notes and gain a deeper understanding of the author's ideas. It‚Äôs a richer, more engaging way to interact with the material. [* ](https://youtu.be/E2zzYE9IrnU?t=390)

On top of this, engaging with a community of like-minded people, such as the Visual Thinking Workshop participants, provides new perspectives and insights that enrich my understanding of the book. Each book adds to my evolving approach, and I'm always excited to see how it develops. [* ](https://youtu.be/E2zzYE9IrnU?t=426)

Reflecting on my journey, I can see how much I've learned and grown through this process. So, if you're looking for a deeper, more meaningful way to engage with the books you read, give this method a try. It might take more time, but the insights and connections you'll gain are definitely worth it. And if you're interested in learning more about visual thinking with Excalidraw and Excalibrain in Obsidian, check out the Visual Thinking Workshop. It's a truly challenging and dense experience but also very rewarding and fun. Cohort 10 starts at the end of August, and I have an early bird offer if you register before the end of June.

In this video, I share  my evolving process for creating Book-on-a-Page visual summaries, inspired by Tiago Forte's Progressive Summarization. Unlike speed reading, my method involves immersing myself in a book over 6-8 weeks, blending research, illustration, and deep thinking.

I start by engaging with the book before reading it, often by listening to interviews with the author. This initial step helps me map out the primary ideas and establish context. As I read, I import my highlights into Obsidian, creating a new file for each chapter to keep my notes organized and maintain context. I then review and illustrate each section, integrating these visuals into my notes.

To enhance my understanding and connections, I use Nick Milo's NoMa method and Vicky Zhao's Idea Compass, mapping ideas spatially in ExcaliBrain. This approach keeps me in constant dialogue with the material, deepening my insights and connections to existing notes.

Finally, I compile these visuals into a cohesive Book-on-a-Page summary, reflecting my personal journey with the book and its integration into my broader knowledge base. This method, while time-intensive, offers rich and engaging insights.

If you're interested in a deeper, more meaningful reading experience, I encourage you to try this method. For more on Visual Thinking with Excalidraw and ExcaliBrain, join the Visual Thinking Workshop. Cohort 10 starts at the end of August, with an early bird offer available until the end of June.
