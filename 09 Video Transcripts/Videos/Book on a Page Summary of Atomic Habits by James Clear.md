Hey and welcome to visual PKM. I'm Zsolt. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=0) Cohort 8 of the Visual Thinking Workshop has just completed. We were reading "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. This video is a quick recap of the ideas that stood out for me from the book. At the end of the video, we will briefly look under the hood and I'll show you how this book on a page is much more than just a pretty picture, so stick around till the end. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=12) 

The book is about becoming the best version of yourself through the simple process of deciding the type of person you want to become and then proving this to yourself with small wins. I'll divide my summary into four parts. We'll first talk about how tiny actions can lead to big differences, then we'll explore why focusing on your identity and on systems is crucial. We'll explore how everything boils down to repetition. Finally, we'll touch on some important topics organized around flow, perception of time, willpower, and context. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=34) 

The key message I took away from the book can be summarized by this single visual: every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. Essentially, the process of building habits is the process of becoming yourself. But this is not a static process; your identity shapes your habits, and in turn, your habits shape your identity. The important thing to keep in mind is how habits will have an impact one way or another in the long run. The quality of our lives depends on the quality of our habits: good habits lead to a good life, while bad habits can lead to disaster. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=60) 

So we can agree habits are important, but what are they anyway? Essentially, habits are behaviors we adopt to solve problems and reduce stress. One person may smoke while another runs. Your habits aren't always optimal; they're just the ones you've found. An atomic habit is a tiny habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results. However, it is far too easy to miss the big picture. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=125)

You can always explain a single decision—if you work late tonight and ignore your family, they will forgive you. But if you do this for an extended period, you'll likely end up in a divorce. There is a myth you should know about: do you believe that big success demands massive effort? Or can it be that there's a better way? Tiny changes can lead to massive results. For example, if you change the direction of an airplane flying from San Francisco to the East Coast just by a fraction, the difference in destination can be New York versus Washington, D.C. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=161)

Habits can drive better quality of life, but major changes require new ways of thinking. It's healthy to reflect on yourself occasionally; a habit scorecard will help you build awareness about your behavior. After all, you must first recognize your habits to alter them. Small changes in habits can profoundly impact your life's direction over the span of moments that make up a lifetime. These choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=237)

However, these changes are not always gradual. Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. Here I want to voice some skepticism. James quotes the British cycling team as an example of the compounding effects of 1% improvements. I'm skeptical about 1% changes because we know old habits are hard to change and our willpower is limited. It is extremely difficult to sustain exponential progress as suggested by James. However, regardless of whether the ongoing improvement is 1%, 0.1%, or less, the right atomic habits will most certainly take us closer to our targets. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=296)

If your objective is to improve by 1% each day, you must be committed and have a robust system to support you. Behind every system of actions are systems of beliefs. People often focus on the outcomes they want, like achieving a six-pack. However, if that is where you stop, you will likely fail. Sustainable results must originate from who you are. Therefore, behavior change is identity change. For instance, think not of the target "I want to run a marathon," but of who you want to become: a runner. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=348)

A runner will go for a workout the day after the marathon, while someone else will likely not. Thus, it is important to express your identity clearly: "I'm a lifelong learner," "I meet deadlines," "I'm a reader," and so on. However, your identity alone is not enough. You also need a system because you do not rise to the level of your goals but fall to the level of your systems. The truth is, we have no other option but to follow where our habits lead us. An astonishing 40 to 50% of the actions you perform every day are done out of habit. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=395)

All behavior is driven by the desire to solve problems, and all habits proceed through these four stages: it always starts with a cue—for example, you're hungry—then continues with a craving as you think of something delicious. This is followed by a response where you cook something or go to a restaurant, and finally concludes with your reward. A successful system must make the habit obvious so you get triggered to do it regularly. Habits must also be attractive so you will want to do them; they must be easy and convenient, and finally, you must make them satisfying so you will want to come back and do them time and time again. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=471)

James argues that a good system will produce good outcomes almost regardless of your intentions. If you love your process, you will feel fulfilled. If you're only after the desired outcome, then you will be on a constant emotional roller coaster and will feel empty when you've reached your goal because goals are only momentary. Throughout the book, you'll find many practical tools and approaches. I'll only highlight a few to give you a flavor. Implementation intentions will help you make the habit obvious; simply attach the desired habit to an event and let autopilot do the rest. For example, "When I get home from work, I will call Mom." Implementation intentions work because they clarify what needs to happen. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=511)

Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. Studies have shown that if you ask people how they will achieve a simple target, such as voting on Election Day, those who were asked to explain how they would travel to the polling station were drastically more likely to vote than those who just stated they would go and vote. You should also ensure the process is fulfilling. James writes about a salesperson who started every day with two jars on his desk—one filled with 200 paper clips and the other empty. Each time he completed a sales call, he moved one clip from jar to jar. Each day he emptied the jar, making 200 goals and feeling satisfied as a result. He closed many deals and rose rapidly in the ranks. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=577)

However, habits will not magically make you into someone you are not. You need to understand yourself and find the game where the odds are in your favor. Ask yourself these questions: What feels like fun to me but work to others? What makes me lose track of time? Where do I get greater returns than the average person? What comes naturally to me? This way, you will have a clear vision of who you want to become and develop a strong system based on cue, craving, response, and reward. Now, you need to train your autopilot to master a habit. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=630)

The key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You don't need to map out every feature of a new habit; you just need to practice it because repeating habits physically changes your brain. This process is called myelination. Essentially, by repeating the habit, you trigger relevant neurons to fire more frequently. In turn, this will strengthen the myelin sheath on the axons, carving a deeper groove in your brain. Reduce emotional friction by making the first two minutes of your habit easy and rewarding, and let autopilot carry you on from there. Repetition is more important than perfection. Master the habit of showing up; you simply can't improve a habit that does not exist. A habit tracker will keep you honest, and the empty squares will motivate you to get going, just like in the case of the paper clips. Trackers can become their own rewards. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=701)

However, there are two pitfalls you should be mindful of. Unfortunately, repetition has a downside as well. When the grooves in your mind are deep enough, you risk getting stuck in a narrative rut. A good approach is to experiment with small changes regularly to avoid getting stuck or bored with your habits. The second pitfall is self-dissonance, which happens when you're forcing a behavior that is simply not you. Habits that are incongruent with your self will not last. So, don't overplan—just do it. Repetition is more important in establishing habits than perfection, and watch out for the narrative rut and self-dissonance. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=760)

Finally, let's talk about flow, the perception of time, willpower, and context. Improvements need to be balanced; as you build skill, you will need more difficult challenges to stay engaged. Seek challenges at the edge of your skills so that you can still make progress and stay motivated. According to Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, you're in a state of flow when the difficulty of the task matches your level of skill. Enjoy the process, not the outcome. No matter what you do, you will always face difficulties; look for the problems you enjoy solving because there are far more problems you will need to overcome than successes to celebrate. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=813)

The fact is, we have the brains of our ancestors but face temptations they never had. What is immediately rewarded is repeated; what is immediately punished is avoided. Our ancestors lived in an immediate return environment, while we now live in a largely delayed return environment. Often, when the immediate consequences are favorable, the later consequences can be disastrous, and vice versa. You might think, "No problem, I'll power through," but sadly, our willpower depletes quickly. Self-control is a short-term strategy that will inevitably fail in the long run. One way to help yourself is to make the undesired habit impractical. A commitment device is the opposite of the two-minute rule; it is a choice you make in the present that will control your actions in the future—like leaving beer in the pantry, not the fridge. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=890)

In summary, discipline is overrated; our habits are triggered by our context. Think about how at a party you're more likely to drink than at the office. This is both good and bad news. The good news is that by better structuring our lives, we can be consistent in our habits without requiring heroic willpower and self-control. By avoiding situations and employing tools like commitment devices, we can break bad habits. The bad news is that we do not forget habits; when we're back in our old context, we will likely fall back into our old habits. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=923)

As we round off this short recap of "Atomic Habits," remember to regularly reflect and review your habits, your progress, and your performance over time. Flexibility to change beats rigidness and toughness. Can one coin make a person rich? If you give a person a pile of 10 coins, you wouldn't claim that he or she is rich. But what if you add another, and then another, and another? The holy grail of habit change is not a single 1% improvement but a thousand of them. Never stop making improvements! [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=972)

I hope you enjoyed this brief summary of "Atomic Habits." If you enjoyed this and are interested in creating similar book-on-a-page summaries, check out the Visual Thinking Workshop. Cohort 9 will start on June 2nd, and we will be reading "The Creative Act" by Rick Rubin. Check the link in the description. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=980)

I created this book on a page using the Excalidraw plugin in Obsidian. For more information, check out the description below. Each of these cards on the board is stored in a separate file. For example, if I open the card about identity-based habits, you can observe two things. First, I can check the backlinks and find all the locations where I make references to this card—in this case, there are the book on a page and my literature notes. If I click to open the literature notes, Obsidian takes me immediately to the section where I first created this card. This is very useful when I want to find the source of an idea. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=1004)

Second, behind the scenes, each card is a markdown file. This is important because I can add additional context to each card that is not visible on the image but available in markdown view. In this case, I linked Simon Sinek’s "Start with Why" and "The Circle of Influence." I could follow these links to further explore my notes, but instead, I want to show you one more neat feature. I have a number of cards on this board that come from other "book on a page" summaries—implementation intentions and some other cards come from the Periodic Table of Productivity. Myelination comes from my book on a page about "Deep Work," and I've used my illustration about flow, for example, in my book on a page about "Decoding Greatness." [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=1090)

The same, of course, is true about the icons I use. I can click to navigate icons, and they will take me to other relevant notes. For example, the man practicing piano appears in many places: my notes about the seven steps for creating concept visuals, my book on a page summary of how to take smart notes, a card from "The Practicing Stoic," and so on. [* ](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=1118)

In this video, I delve into the key takeaways from Atomic Habits by James Clear. As we wrap up Cohort 8 of the Visual Thinking Workshop, I reflect on the essence of the book and its application to our lives. We explore how tiny actions can lead to significant outcomes, emphasizing the importance of focusing on our identity and building effective systems.

The book emphasizes that every action we take is a vote for the type of person we wish to become. By understanding the power of habits, we can shape our identities and ultimately our lives. However, the process isn't static; it requires commitment and the right systems.

I dissect the four stages of habits and discuss the significance of making habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. Additionally, I share practical tools like implementation intentions and habit trackers to aid in habit formation.

Furthermore, we examine the concepts of flow, perception of time, willpower, and context. Understanding these factors helps us navigate challenges and stay consistent with our habits.

Ultimately, the goal isn't perfection but continuous improvement. By making small, consistent changes, we can achieve remarkable results over time. Join me as we explore the transformative power of habits and unlock our full potential.

sounds](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=272) [small but it is a huge change in](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=277) [reality because old habits are hard to](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=280) [change and our will power is limited it](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=283) [is extremely hard to sustain exponential](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=287) [progress as suggested

right Atomic habits will most](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=302) [certainly take us closer to our](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=305) [targets and this takes us to part two](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=309) [because if your objective is to improve](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=312) [with 1% each day you must be really](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=314) [committed and must have a robust system](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=318) [to support](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=321) [you behind every system of actions are a](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=322) [system of beliefs people often Focus on](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=326) [the outcome you want the sixpack then](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=330) [you realize that you must hit the gym](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=333) [regularly to build that but if this is](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=336) [where you stop you will likely

[shouldn't stop there an identity alone](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=382) [is not enough you also need a system](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=386) [because you do not rise to the level

[option but to follow where our habits](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=398) [lead us and astonishing 40 to 50% of the](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=401) [actions you perform every day are

[something or go to a restaurant and](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=431) [finally concludes with your](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=434) [reward a successful system must make the](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=437) [Habit obvious so you get triggered to do](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=441) [it regularly habits must also be](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=444) [attractive so you will want to do it](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=447) [they must be easy and convenient and](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=450) [finally you must make them satisfying so](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=453) [you will want to come back and do it](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=456) [again and again and again James argues](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=459) [that a good system will produce good](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=463) [outcomes almost regardless of your](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=466) [intentions if you love your process you](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=469) [will feel fulfilled if you're only after](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=471) [the desired outcome then you will be on](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=474) [a

[help you make the Habit obvious simply](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=498) [attach the desired Habit to an event and](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=501) [let autopilot do the rest for

[because they make it clear what needs to](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=514) [happen when you see many people think](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=517) [they lack motivation when what they](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=520) [really lack is Clarity Studies have](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=522) [shown that if you ask people how they](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=525) [are going to achieve a simple Target](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=528) [such as voting on Election Day those who](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=531) [were asked to explain how they will](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=534) [travel to the polling station were](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=537) [drastically more likely to vote than](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=539) [those who

about](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=548) [a salesperson who started every day with](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=552) [two jars on his desk one filled with 200](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=555)

[and rewarding and let autopilot carry](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=679) [you on from there repetition is more](https://youtu.be/FfOYjTnyPbs?t=682) [important than Perfection Master
