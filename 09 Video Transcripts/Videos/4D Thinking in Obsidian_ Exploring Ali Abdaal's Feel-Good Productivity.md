![4D Thinking in Obsidian: Exploring Ali Abdaal's Feel-Good Productivity](https://youtu.be/dCRjIUqi2ng)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt explores the concept of 4D Thinking in Obsidian, inspired by Ali Abdaal's approach to productivity. He demonstrates how to utilize the Excalidraw and Excalibrain plugins within Obsidian for effective personal knowledge management (PKM) and interconnected thinking. Zsolt emphasizes the importance of visual tools for enhancing learning and idea retention.

# Key Takeaways
- The Periodic Table of Productivity is a framework that connects various productivity concepts and personal insights.
- The compass of Zettelkasten can guide idea organization by evaluating concepts from multiple perspectives: North, South, West, and East.
- Integrating visual tools like Excalidraw and Excalibrain can significantly enhance personal knowledge management and idea connections.

Hey everyone, it's Zsolt. Welcome back to the channel! Today we are diving into the behind-the-scenes exploration of the Periodic Table of productivity, inspired by Ali Abdaal's feel-good productivity. If you haven't seen my previous video on this topic, be sure to check it out for some context. We're going to cover a lot of ground today, so buckle up! We'll look at how I've connected the ideas in Ali's book with other concepts in my Obsidian Vault. We'll explore how I've applied the concept of the compass of Zettelkasten for creating these connections, talk about the concept of 4D Personal Knowledge Management (PKM), and how I use Obsidian MD plus the Excalidraw and Excalibrain plugins as my 4D PKM system, and a whole lot more. I've dedicated videos on many of the topics we'll touch on; you'll find the links in the video description. This video is a live demonstration of the mindset and PKM approach I've developed over the past 20-plus years. My hope is that by the end of this video, you'll agree with me that this mindset is one of the most effective approaches to learning and connecting your ideas. Let's dive in! [* ](https://youtu.be/dCRjIUqi2ng?t=0)

I use Obsidian MD and the Excalidraw plugin as my primary thinking tools. Let's start by opening Excalidraw with the Periodic Table. Now, what might not be immediately obvious from this Periodic Table is how each of the tiles or experiments, following Ali's terminology from the book, is a separate document that is linked to other notes in my vault. I have over 10,000 notes in Obsidian, each heavily connected to other notes in my vault. Obsidian calls the folder that contains all my markdown documents a vault, where each document is a note. In reality, a vault is just a folder on my PC, and Excalidraw drawings are also stored in markdown files, which makes them super versatile, as you'll see in a second. Let's start by opening the "Choose Your Character" tile. I can do that by control-clicking on the image. I could edit the tile now, but that is not what I want to show you. Remember I mentioned that Excalidraw drawings are stored in markdown notes? This means that you can open an Excalidraw file in two modes: the Excalidraw view mode, where the drawing is editable, and the markdown view mode, where you can think of this as flipping a sheet of paper. On one side of the paper, you have the drawing; on the back side, you have your notes about the drawing. Let's now flip the drawing by clicking to open it in markdown view mode. This is where I store my interconnected references. Let's quickly look at them one by one. I could spend hours just on this set of references because these connections are so rich, but today I'm going to move quickly. [* ](https://youtu.be/dCRjIUqi2ng?t=60)

First up is my reference to the concept of "self-revealing" from James P. Carse's book "Finite and Infinite Games." The point Carse highlights in his book is how playing roles is relevant to every situation. Imagine an actress playing her part, let's say Ophelia in a Shakespeare play. Now consider that at the end of the play, she meets her audience and afterward goes home to her children. It's easy to understand that when she steps off the stage, she leaves behind one role, the role of Ophelia, to take on another role, the role of the actress. When she goes home, she takes on the role of a mother. She has many other roles as well: the role of a wife, daughter, maybe sister, and citizen, and so on. Choosing our roles deliberately for the task at hand, as Ali suggests, is not such a foreign idea after all. I could talk about this for hours; if you're interested in my book on a page summary of Carse's book, you'll find the link in the description. My next association is how the idea of learning to act in the nature of a character is similar to the ability of speaking in the voice of the author. The idea of speaking in the author's voice is mentioned in "The Art of Close Reading," a short essay I highly recommend reading for anyone interested in learning from books. However, you might be tempted to play characters that do not come naturally. Strength Finder by Gallup is an interesting assessment that led me to eventually start this YouTube channel. The idea behind Strength Finder is to understand your natural strengths: the roles you prefer playing, and instead of working on roles you are not drawn to, capitalize on those that you naturally perform. To some extent, this idea contradicts or challenges Ali's idea of choosing our character. [* ](https://youtu.be/dCRjIUqi2ng?t=90)

Thinking about personalities reminded me of the PKM personalities by Nick Milo and Thiago Forte. I won't go into implications now, but I think this is a very interesting aspect to consider as well. Some concepts that supercharge the idea of choosing your character include the idea that imitation is a powerful approach for achieving outstanding results. This is why I've connected Ali's idea to my visual note on the secrets of extraordinary achievement from my notes on "Decoding Greatness" by Ron Friedman. By now, you might be wondering about these tags or rather data view fields at the beginning of each reference. On a side note, Data View is another essential Obsidian plugin which we will not dive into today. Earlier, I introduced the compass of Zettelkasten, a concept I learned about from Vicki and Failing Chang at the Linking Your Thinking Conference. This compass is a powerful tool for organizing your thoughts, guiding you in different directions: North, South, West, and East. In our exploration today, we're leveraging this concept in the context of the Periodic Table of Productivity. These fields implement similar challenges and remind me of how to supercharge following the compass of Zettelkasten by creating a structured framework—or you could call it an ontology—for understanding and connecting ideas. If you're new to this concept, it's about looking at your ideas from various perspectives. Looking North explores the origins and bigger categories, while South identifies instances or examples. West delves into similar and supporting ideas, and East looks for ideas that compete with the central concept. As you can see, I have categorized my field names based on the directions of the compass. [* ](https://youtu.be/dCRjIUqi2ng?t=180)

Now let's connect these references visually with Excalibrain. "Choose Your Character" is now at the center. See how each of the links is positioned North, South, West, and East, mirroring the compass of Zettelkasten. If I hover over each element in Excalibrain, it will bring up a preview of each of the connected ideas. To the North, we find the Periodic Table, my literature notes, and the idea of playing roles because I consider choosing my character as an implementation of that concept. To the West, I have the ideas that are in some way similar: speaking in the author's voice and the PKM personalities by Nick Milo and Thiago Forte. To the East, there are ideas that either challenge or supercharge all these ideas in the book: the benefits of imitation from the extended mind, reverse engineering from "Decoding Greatness," and my personality assessments from Strength Finder and Myers-Briggs. Finally, to the South, you can see each of the illustrations. Now, if I click on the Periodic Table of productivity, I will be taken back to the periodic table. Under the periodic table, you will see the 52 tiles linked to the South, or as children using the Excalibrain terminology. Let's click on "Embrace Your Curiosity." As you're now familiar with the idea of the compass, you can see I have connected ideas all around this tile in all directions. A hidden value of the compass of Zettelkasten is that when I don't see ideas in one direction or another, I know I'm likely biased. Most often, what happens is I'm missing an idea to the East, the ideas that contradict or challenge the idea at the center. But the final bit I wanted to show you today is how I apply the idea integration board concept (see references in the description below) to explore all the various instances of curiosity in my Obsidian vault. I connect these ideas by referencing the same icon in each of these instances. By the way, the small numbers you see at the connector points, called gates, are the number of connections in a given direction; this helps me see how busy each direction will be. The bit I want to show you is the idea integration board. Simply put, the idea integration board is a visual board where I explore the various concept illustrations. There, I use a given icon, curiosity in this case, and choose the relationship between these. My theory behind this is that we are sometimes unconsciously drawn to the same visual representation for ideas that we would not connect in our minds by default. It is often that I find unexpected but meaningful connections between ideas while building and exploring these idea integration boards. It's fascinating to see how curiosity is the differentiator between leaders and followers, how curiosity acts as our filter for ideas, how it is a source of motivation, and how it is linked to our deepest desire for seeking truth.

In closing, let's explore a fundamental truth: lasting change requires a mental shift and internalization of ideas. The mindset for 4D PKM excels at making concepts a part of our mental landscape, facilitating internalization and leading to lasting change. This tool is more than a catalyst for transformation; it bridges the gap between concept and application, enhancing your ability to summarize, problem-solve, and see the big picture as you embark on your learning journey. Remember, it's about making knowledge a part of who you are. Our exploration of 4D thinking in Obsidian concludes here today.
