![Da Vinci, Einstein, Jobs, Musk: What's their shared secret?](https://youtu.be/KQ34mSMpTwI)

# Summary
This video explores the commonalities between influential figures such as Leonardo da Vinci, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, and Elon Musk, particularly focusing on their visual thinking capabilities. The speaker suggests that their ability to visualize complex ideas may stem from childhood challenges, including dyslexia and other learning difficulties. This visual thinking process is illustrated by examples of how Musk applies visualization in problem-solving within engineering and manufacturing contexts.

# Key Takeaways
- Influential thinkers like Da Vinci, Einstein, Jobs, and Musk share a tendency towards visual thinking.
- Many of these figures overcame childhood challenges, such as dyslexia, that may have enhanced their visual learning abilities.
- Visualization plays a crucial role in problem-solving, especially in fields like engineering and manufacturing.

# Content
So, uh, are there parallels you see between Elon, Steve Jobs, Einstein, and Da Vinci? I think they were all visual thinkers, perhaps coming from slight handicaps as children. Meaning, you know, Leonardo was left-handed and a little bit dyslexic, I think. Um, and certainly Einstein had issues; he would repeat things and was slow in learning to talk. So, I think visualizing helps a lot, and with Musk, I see it all the time when I'm walking the factory lines with him. He can visualize the material science. I know that seems minor, but I could give you 500 of those where, on any given day, he's visualizing the physics of an engineering or manufacturing problem. [* ](https://youtu.be/KQ34mSMpTwI?t=0)
