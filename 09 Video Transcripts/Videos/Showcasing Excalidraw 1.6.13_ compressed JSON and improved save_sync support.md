# Content
Welcome! I'd like to walk you through the new features and enhancements in Excalidraw version 1.6.13. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=0) Let me start with the most important new feature, which is the compressed JSON option. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=8) The reason for implementing this is to unclutter the search results in Obsidian. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=14) Let me just demonstrate to you how this works.

For example, on this page, I have this text "morph frequent auto save," and in search, when I look for this term, I get multiple hits on the same document. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=24) This happens because when I switch over to Markdown view, you can see that the text is repeated within the file format of the Excalidraw file. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=35) Now, if I turn on the zipping function, which you can do in Excalidraw settings, you just need to enable "compress Excalidraw JSON in Markdown." [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=49) If I turn this on and save the document, this only applies to the documents that you save; it will not retrospectively compress all of your documents. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=64) But you can immediately see that the other search results have disappeared, and now I only get a single result that matches my text element in the drawing. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=78)

What I also did is, you can still edit the document in Markdown view, and when I switch over to Markdown view, it appears as if this is not compressed. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=85) That is actually the case because when you choose this option to open a document in Markdown, Excalidraw will save the document as uncompressed. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=96) As you will see, the search results are still here until autosave activates. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=112) Once autosave kicks in, suddenly the search results disappear. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=117) 

Also, you can still edit Markdown and the drawing side by side. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=120) For example, this is my text element, and let me just demonstrate to you if I open this up in split view. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=126) If I open this version in Markdown, then I can come here and see that this is my text element. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=144) I can edit this in Markdown, and you can see that on the left-hand side, my edits appeared. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=155) Now, if I come back again, the search results for now are all here because while I was editing this in Markdown mode, the file was not compressed, but it will compress again, and then the search results will disappear. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=173) 

Long story short, I think this is a great feature to unclutter your search results. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=178) A nice new feature, though it's not very in your face, is improved synchronization support. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=182) For example, this mind map that I created was with my desktop for typing text, while I had my iPad open next to my desktop for drawing lines with a pen. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=194) The synchronization support worked smoothly. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=210) 

If I modify the document, look at the disk icon up there. For example, if I move something, the disk icon will turn red until autosave kicks in. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=216) When autosave does activate, the disk icon will turn white again. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=229) You can go to settings, and within settings, you can enable autosave. By default, it should be enabled. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=233) You can also set the interval for autosave; I actually set this to 15 seconds. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=240) 

With that frequency, if I make modifications, those changes will synchronize to my desktop or iPad pretty quickly. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=246) I also made some edits to the color palette, so now you can have any size of a color palette. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=264) I might have overdone this a bit for myself, but I added a very long list of colors to my color palette. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=270) You can set this up in a template, which I had a video on. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=283) You need to set your colors like this.

For the release today, I have a link to my color palette if you want to use it. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=298) You can see that these lines here are kind of organic. I like organic mind maps, so I created a small script you can find in the script store called "organic lines." [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=321) This script allows you to draw lines, and when you press the button, it turns the line into an organic shape, resembling a tree trunk. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=336) 

If you like this organic look and feel for your mind maps, I recommend trying the organic line script. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=371) There's another cool script called "repeat elements." Let me demonstrate what the repeat elements script can do. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=382) You draw two shapes, position them as you like, and then select them to execute the repeat elements script. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=394) If I decide to repeat these five times, you can see that it repeats the transformation that many times, allowing you to create interesting graphics and designs. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=413)

If you enjoy drawing, I highly recommend installing the repeat element script. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=421) There's also a bit of mobile goodness: the link button in the mobile toolbar. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=435) This makes it easier to create a link directly. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=446) 

Finally, I added some functions to Excalidraw "automate," which are polar manipulation functions. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=454) I created this feature sometime back. For instance, if I open my markdown document, you'll see that this is actually a code block with the new functions. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=467) You can specify CSS, like the yellow border around the object via this CSS as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=480) If I click this link, it'll take me to the discussion on GitHub where you can find my entire CSS for this markdown. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=491) 

To make this work, you need to set up a CSS file for how the markdown is formatted when it’s dropped into Excalidraw. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=501) You need to scroll down to the markdown embed settings and set up a markdown CSS file. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=514) 

This markdown CSS is simply a text file that serves as a style sheet for the markdown document. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=523) That way, you can do a lot of things. For instance, let me quickly add a table here. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=548) I hope I'm going to be successful. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=556) 

There we go! This might be a silly table, but it gets the message across. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=563) You can see here’s my table; these should be headers A and B, but now the table looks slightly more meaningful. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=577) 

This markdown embed feature is very powerful; you can accomplish a lot with it. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=619) So that is the summary of all the features in the new Excalidraw release. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=622) I hope you will find them helpful and enjoy them. Please raise any suggestions or issues that you encounter on GitHub; I try to respond to those pretty quickly. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=634) Many of the features I'm showcasing today are in response to the requests you’ve raised on GitHub. [* ](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=641) Thank you!

[because](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=164) [while i was editing this in markdown](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=165) [mode then these um](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=167) [the file was not compressed but then](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=170) [it will compress again and it it will](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=173) [disappear so long story short uh i think](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=175) [this is a great feature to unclutter](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=178) [your search results](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=180) [then i think the other nice new feature](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=182) [though it's not very in your face](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=185) [but i improved a lot on the](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=188) [synchronization support so for example](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=191) [this drawing or this mind map i created](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=194) [that i was actually using my desktop to](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=197) [type in the text and i had my ipad open](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=200) [next to my desktop and i was drawing the](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=203) [lines with a pen and with the](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=205) [synchronization support this actually](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=208) [worked pretty smoothly also if i modify](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=210) [the document look at that disk icon up](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=213) [there so for example i move this](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=216) [then the disk will turn red until the](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=218) [auto save kicks in and when auto save](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=222) [kicks in then the](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=224) [disk will turn](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=227) [white again](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=229) [now you can go to settings and within](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=230) [settings](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=233) [here you can](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=234) [enable auto save by default this should](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=236) [be enabled](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=239) [and you can set the interval for auto](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=240) [save i actually set this to 15 seconds](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=242) [and that is because](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=246) [with that frequency](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=248) [if i make modifications those](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=250) [modifications will be synchronized to my](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=252) [desktop](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=255) [or to my desktop or to my ipad pretty](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=256) [quickly](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=259) [i also did a bit of](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=261) [editing on the color palette so now you](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=264) [can have any size of a color palette and](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=267) [i actually](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=270) [maybe overdid this for myself a bit but](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=271) [so for example here i added a very long](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=274) [list of colors to my color palette the](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=278) [way you can do this is](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=281) [here in](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=283) [i you need to set up a template and i](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=286) [had a video on it and within the](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=288) [template](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=291) [you need to set your colors like this so](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=293) [this is my list of colors on the github](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=296) [page for today's release i have a link](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=298) [uh taking you to the location where you](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=301) [can find my color palette if](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=304) [by any chance you would want to use this](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=307) [color palette for yourself](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=309) [then you can see that these](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=313) [lines here are](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=316) [sort of organic i like organic mind maps](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=318) [and so i created a small script that you](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=321) [can find in the script store called](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=324) [organic lines and so what this does is](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=326) [if i draw a line like this](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=329) [and let's](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=332) [press this button up here so this is my](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=333) [script button then it turns this line](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=336) [maybe this was of course so this is](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=338) [nicer than you draw this with a pen but](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=340) [let me just](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=343) [draw a line like this and if i uh press](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=344) [the button then you can see that this](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=348) [line becomes organic in the sense that](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=350) [it's like a tree the trunk is](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=353) [uh wider and the](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=356) [end is much thinner you can make the](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=358) [line](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=361) [a bit more wide and then you can see the](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=362) [effect um](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=366) [i like the sort of line in my mind map](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=368) [if you like this](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=371) [look and feel then i recommend you go](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=373) [ahead and try](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=375) [the](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=376) [organic line script there's another](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=378) [cool script](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=382) [that you can find now in the script](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=383) [store and that's called the repeat](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=386) [elements and let me just demonstrate to](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=388) [you what the repeat elements is able to](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=391) [do so you draw two](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=394) [shapes](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=398) [and you position those two shapes the](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=399) [way you want to](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=401) [then repeat them and when you select](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=402) [them and you execute the repeat element](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=405) [scripts let's maybe repeat this five](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=407) [times then you can see that it repeats](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=410) [the](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=413) [transformation](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=414) [that many times and you can create some](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=416) [cool graphics and](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=418) [almost you can call it art](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=421) [using this feature i if you like to play](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=423) [with the drawing then i highly recommend](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=426) [installing the repeat element script](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=429) [there's a bit of mobile goodness which](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=432) [is the link button in the mobile toolbar](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=435) [so here](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=438) [if](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=439) [i](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=441) [come here you can see that there's the](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=442) [create link button so that's](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=444) [easier to](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=446) [create a link like that](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=448) [and then finally i added some functions](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=451) [to x call it raw automate which are](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=454) [these polar manipulation functions and](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=456) [what i want to show you is this is](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=460) [actually a feature that](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=462) [i created sometime back so here this is](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=464) [a markdown document if i open it on the](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=467) [side you can see that this is actually](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=469) [the](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=472) [code block with the new functions and i](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=473) [can also specify a css in this case the](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=476) [yellow border around the object is via](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=480) [this css as well here if i click this](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=484) [link then it will take me to](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=488) [the discussion on github where i have my](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=491) [entire css for this markdown because](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=494) [what you need to](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=497) [do is you need to](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=499) [set up a css for how the markdown is](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=501) [formatted when it's dropped into](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=505) [x collet rom and then you need to go to](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=508) [x call it raw settings and here](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=510) [you need to scroll down quite a bit to](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=514) [so this is under markdown embed settings](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=517) [and you need to set up a markdown css](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=520) [file so that's the one that](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=523) [i will link to this video again and that](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=525) [file is simply a](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=529) [mark down css that markdown css is](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=531) [simply](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=535) [a text file](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=536) [that is a style sheet for the markdown](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=538) [document and that way you can](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=542) [do lots of stuff so for example](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=545) [here i can also include a table let me](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=548) [just add a quick table here](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=551) [hopefully](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=556) [i'm going to be successful](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=557) [there we go and](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=560) [that's the i mean now this is going to](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=563) [be a very silly table uh but i think it](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=565) [will get the message across so you can](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=568) [see here's my my table of course these](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=570) [should be](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=573) [header](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=575) [a and b maybe and then it the table is](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=577) [going to be going to look slightly](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=580) [more meaningful like that so](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=583) [because i messed up my](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=586) [table](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=589) [what the heck did i do](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=591) [oh](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=599) [yes](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=599) [because i](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=601) [yeah like this so now the table is a](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=602) [correct markdown table](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=605) [and](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=607) [it takes a few seconds and then you see](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=608) [for example you can bring in a table as](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=610) [well but uh frankly this markdown embed](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=612) [is very powerful you can do a lot of uh](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=616) [a lot of stuff with this](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=619) [so](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=620) [that is the summary of all the features](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=622) [in the new xcali draw release](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=625) [i hope you will find them helpful enjoy](https://youtu.be/xHPGWR3m0c8?t=628) [them and please raise any suggestions
