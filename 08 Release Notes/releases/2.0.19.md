## Fixed
- When updating Excalidraw, some open drawings weren't automatically reopening. I hope I got this fixed (note this change will only have an effect when you receive the update after this).
- In dark mode, the frame header is challenging to see when modified [#1568](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1568).

## New
- Crop PDF pages:
  - Available in Excalidraw, Markdown Notes, and on the Canvas.
  - Crop the active page from the embedded PDF viewer and insert the cropped image into the current view, both in Excalidraw and on Canvas.
- New Command Palette Action: "Insert active PDF page as image." This action is functional in Excalidraw. If an embedded Obsidian-PDF-viewer is present, executing this command will insert the active page as an image into the Excalidraw scene.
- Two new settings introduced:
  - "Basic" section allows setting the folder for crop files.
  - "Saving/filename" section enables setting the prefix for crop files.
- PDF import now defaults to importing all pages.
- Rounded corners now available for images.
- Second-order links now encompass forward links from embedded Excalidraw Files.
- Clicking a cropped file in a markdown note or on Canvas will prompt to open the original file, not just the cropper.
