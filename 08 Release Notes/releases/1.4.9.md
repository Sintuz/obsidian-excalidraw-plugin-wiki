Excalidraw will run a housekeeping process to patch drawings to support WYSIWYG transclusion 7 minutes after installing the update. 7 minutes is allowed for sync to complete before running the patch.

# New Features
- A bridging solution to support Obsidian 0.13.2 WYSIWYG until markdownPostProcessor is implemented natively. This only works for Excalidraw.md files. Sadly I can't offer a solution for legacy .excalidraw files.

# Improved Features
- Handling of recursively embedded images work, also catching infinite loops
- Reintroduced the option to choose between SVG or PNG for preview
- Removed SVG snapshot. This will generate much smaller files
