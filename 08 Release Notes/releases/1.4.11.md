1.4.11 comes with a number of QoL improvements!

# Fixed
- #230: embedded images no longer show inverted colors. The solution was tested and works on Windows and on Android. Sadly it does not resolve inversion in dark mode on iOS. I haven't tested it on Mac. Seems that the root cause is the lack of context filtering support on Safari (see [#4301](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/4301) for further details)

# New features
- This version includes the recently released new Excalidraw library component. Now you can publish to the Excalidraw public stencil library directly from Obsidian. See for more details: https://twitter.com/aakansha1216/status/1461045987678453760?s=20

## New in settings

- #122: Setting to enable Excalidraw to follow Obsidian's theme. When the theme changes, open Excalidraw views will automatically update to light or dark mode.
- [#262](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/262), [#43](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/43), #198: You can now select a default mode for opening drawings (e.g. to open in view mode or zen mode by default).  The feature also includes a new front-matter key with the following recognized values:
```
excalidraw-default-mode: normal
excalidraw-default-mode: view
excalidraw-default-mode: zen
```

- [#251](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/251), [#122](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/122) : Excalidraw preview to match Obsidian Theme. If enabled, when Obsidian is in dark mode, Excalidraw images will render in dark mode. When Obsidian is in light mode, Excalidraw will render in light mode as well. You may try switching 'Export image with background' off for a more Obsidian-integrated look and feel.
