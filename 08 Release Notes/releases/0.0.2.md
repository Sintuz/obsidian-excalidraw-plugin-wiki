Release notes:
Key change: now integrated into Obsidian file Explorer.
Transclusion is next!
It works but I haven't yet gotten around to solving transclusion into .md files.


To Install:
Copy the 3 files main.js, manifest.json, styles.css to the vault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/ folder.
