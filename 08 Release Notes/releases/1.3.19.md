## Fix:
- [#188](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/188) ALT+CTRL click on a link to create document was broken. 
- Since open in adjacent pane feature (1.3.17), Shift+CTRL click threw an error if there was only a single pane open in the workspace.

# New features:
- Excalidraw component includes the latest fixes including [fix: freehand points](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/4031) which should further improve the iPad freehand experience.
- [#187](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/187) Links may include a linebreak to fit smaller spaces, they will still work
- [#182](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/182) Excalidraw is more forgiving about the formatting of the `# Drawing` section
- [#189](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/189) added setting to adjust default theme of drawing (dark/light) with Obsidian theme. Only works in case there is no template set. Also, an existing drawing will be opened in the theme it was saved.
