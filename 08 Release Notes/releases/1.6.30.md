## Fixed
- The load library button stopped working [#625](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/625).
- On iPad (probably other Obsidian mobile platforms as well) after opening the command palette the positioning of the pointer was off. From now on, the pointer is now automatically re-calibrated every 5 seconds.
- I improved collaboration sync. If the open file has not been saved for the last 5 minutes (i.e. you are not working on it actively), and a remote newer version is received via sync, then the remote file will simply overwrite the local file (i.e. the behavior of Excalidraw Obsidian prior to implementing Share Vault Synchronization support in 1.6.29). This solution helps distinguish between active collaboration when parties participating are actively editing, but also caters to the scenario when you open a drawing on one device (e.g. your home desktop) and once you are finished editing you do not close the drawing, but simply put your PC to sleep... Later you edit the same drawing on your tablet. When you turn on your desktop the next time, the changes you made on your tablet are synchronized. The changes from your tablet should be honored, there is no value in running the file comparison between the local version and the received one... this reduces the probability of running into sync conflicts.
