 # This release is available via BRAT for testing

## New
- Supports css classes in frontmatter. You can now apply Canvas Candy classes and the Excalidraw drawings you embed into Obsidian Canvas will apply the classes properly. e.g. `cssclasses: cc-border-none` will result in an Excalidraw drawing on canvas without the canvas node border around it.
- New context menu actions to
  - navigate to link (or image in case of embedded image),
  - add any file from the vault to the canvas
  - to convert the selected text element or sticky note to an embedded markdown file, and 
  - to add a link from the Vault to the selected element
- Frames are rendered in exported images.
- SVG Export now includes the `.excalidraw-svg` class. This can be used to post process svgs using publish.js when using custom domains with Obsidian Publish. There is also a new command palette action to check if SVG exports are out of date (i.e. the drawing or some of the embedded elements in the drawing have changed since the SVG was exported).

## Fixed and improved
- Mermaid Timeline graph has all black [#1424](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1424)
- The complete line button for multipoint lines on mobile was disabled making it impossible to finish editing the line
