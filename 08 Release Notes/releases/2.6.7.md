Hoping to finally move on to 2.7.0... but still have one last bug to fix in 2.6.x!

## Fixed
I misread a line in the Excalidraw package code... ended up breaking image loading in 2.6.6. The icon library script didn't work right, and updating nested drawings caused all images in the scene to be dropped from memory. This led to image placeholders in exports and broke copy-paste to Excalidraw.com and between drawings. I am surprised no one reported it! ðŸ˜³
