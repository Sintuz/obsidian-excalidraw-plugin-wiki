# New
- **Templater support**: You can now execute Templater scripts on an embedded Markdown document when the document is active for editing
- **Interactive image-embeds**: I added a new image embed option "SVG Native". In "SVG Native" mode embedded items such as videos, webpages, and links (including links within the Vault) work.
- **Anchored image resizing**: When you embed an Excalidraw drawing using the Anchor to 100% option, resizing the image will be disabled.

# Fixed
- when opening a new document in the Excalidraw view while a markdown document was open for editing in an embeddable, Excalidraw terminated with errors
 
# New in ExcalidrawAutomate
- added openState to the `openFileInNewOrAdjacentLeaf. For details see: [OpenViewState](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/f86f95386d439c19d9a77831d5cac5748d80e7ec/obsidian.d.ts#L2686-L2695)
```typescript
openFileInNewOrAdjacentLeaf(file: TFile, openState?: OpenViewState): WorkspaceLeaf
```
