# Fixes
- You were not able to modify the text properties of a text element while editing the text in tray mode. [496](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/496)
- iframely friendly page titles from web links did not work reliably. I reworked the logic, should work better now.
- Improved resilience of loading from a damaged Excalidraw.md file.

# New Features
## From Excalidraw.com
- Added Eraser [4887](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/4887)

## Plugin
- New setting for default transcluded-text line-wrap length. This is the default value for "wrapAt" in `![[file#^block]]{wrapAt}`. Wrapping text using this feature will insert linebreaks in the transcluded text. An alternative approach is to transclude text inside sticky notes, in which case Excalidraw will automatically take care of text wrapping depending on the sticky note's width. [228](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/228)
- New command palette action to toggle Excalidraw fullscreen mode. This allows you to set a hotkey for fullscreen mode.
- I added basic support for left-handed users. You can enable left-handed mode in plugin settings under the "Display" section. Currently, only affects the position of the elements tray in tray-mode. [510](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/510)
- Added more flexibility for defining the filename for drawings. ⚠Due to the change, current settings may behave slightly differently compared to before.⚠[470](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/470)
