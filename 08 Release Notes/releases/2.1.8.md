## Fixed
- Fixing issues that surfaced after Obsidian 1.6.0
  - Support for new hover preview CSS
  - Cursor color for links, text elements, and frame names. Became invisible if Obsidian was in dark mode and Excalidraw in light mode.
  - Rendering Excalidraw drawings in Markdown views, right after Obsidian loaded did not work.
- More graceful fail when malformed SVG is submitted for SVG to Excalidraw conversation. [#1768](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1768)

## New
- New setting under "Save" in plugin settings to NOT decompress JSON when switching to Markdown view mode. For details see description under "Save" settings. The benefit is smaller file size and fewer results in the Obsidian search. If you want to edit the JSON, you can always manually decompress JSON in markdown view mode with the command palette action "Excalidraw: Decompress JSON".
