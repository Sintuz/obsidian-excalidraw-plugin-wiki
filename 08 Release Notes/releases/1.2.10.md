## New Features
- using latest Excalidraw build, now includes mobile UNDO/REDO buttons
- [#100](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/100) Implemented WYSIWYG for text elements. 
  - Drawings no longer need to be changed from locked to unlocked mode. When an element is edited the underlying Markdown is displayed for editing.
  - Changed LOCK/UNLOCK to RAW/PREVIEW mode. In raw mode, markdown is displayed always.
- [#107](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/107) Added PNG export scale setting. The setting applies to auto-export as well as to embeds and on-demand exports.
- [#95](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/95) Added support for `#tags`. Clicking a TAG will open up the search.
- [#109](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/109) Added button to toggle Excalidraw full-screen mode

# Fixes
- Auto export was not working. Fixed.
- When the same drawing was open on two devices, with Obsidian Sync active, if the drawing was edited on device 1, device 2 triggered an autosave sometimes overwriting the changes on the first device. Fixed.
- [#101](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/101) pointer precision degraded over time. Fixed by deploying the latest Excalidraw build.
- [#97](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/97) workaround implemented for exporting stencil library and drawings in Excalidraw format on mobile. Don't have a solution for ChromeOS yet.
