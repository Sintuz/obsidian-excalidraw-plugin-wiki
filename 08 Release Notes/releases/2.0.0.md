## New
- Added support for applying CSS classes in frontmatter. Now, when embedding Excalidraw drawings into Obsidian Canvas, you can use [Canvas Candy](https://tfthacker.com/canvas-candy) classes. For instance, `cssclasses: cc-border-none` removes the canvas node border around the drawing.
- Introduced new context menu actions:
  - Navigate to link or embedded image.
  - Add any file from the vault to the canvas.
  - Convert the selected text element or sticky note to an embedded markdown file.
  - Add a link from the Vault to the selected element.
- Frames are now rendered in exported images.
- SVG Export includes the `.excalidraw-svg` class, enabling post-processing of SVGs using publish.js when using custom domains with Obsidian Publish. Also, added a command palette action `Obsidian Publish: Find SVG and PNG exports that are out of date`.
- Added a new Command palette action to open the corresponding Excalidraw file based on the embedded SVG or PNG file. `Open Excalidraw Drawing` [Issue #1411](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1411)

## Fixed and Improved
- Resolved issue with the Mermaid Timeline graph displaying all black. [Issue #1424](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1424)
- Enabled toggling pen mode off after activation by a pen touch.
- Now you are able to unlock elements on mobile; previously, locked elements couldn't be selected.
