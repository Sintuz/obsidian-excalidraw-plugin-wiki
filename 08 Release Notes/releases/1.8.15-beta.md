!!! Modifier keys have changed, please review the table below!

## Fixed 
- This version was extensively tested and developed on MacOS to remove usability issues.
- New command palette action to create a new drawing in a new tab
- Modifier keys to open links in the active window, splitting the current view to the right, in a new tab, or in a popout window now behave consistently both in Excalidraw and when clicking a drawing that is embedded in a markdown note.
- Drag & Drop properly works from within Obsidian, from a web browser, and from the OS file explorer
