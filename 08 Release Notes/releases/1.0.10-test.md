## 1.0.10 Update
[![Obsidian-Excalidraw 1.0.10 update](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14358394/117579017-60a58800-b0f1-11eb-8553-7820964662aa.jpg)](https://youtu.be/W7pWXGIe4rQ)

## New Features
- Temporary workaround to enable Obsidian Sync for Excalidraw files. This enables almost real-time two-way sync between your devices. You can draw on your iPad with your pencil, on your Android with your stylus, and the image will be available in Obsidian as well and vice versa. 
- I added an autosave feature. Your active drawing gets saved every 30 seconds if you've made changes to it. Drawings otherwise get saved when the window loses focus, or when you close the drawing, etc. Autosave limits the risk of accidental data loss on mobiles when you "swipe out" Obsidian to close it.

## To Install:
- Exit Obsidian. 
- Copy the 3 files main.js, manifest.json, styles.css to the vault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/ folder. 
- Restart Obsidian.
