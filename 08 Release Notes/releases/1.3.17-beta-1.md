Please use [Image Element Preview 2](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/releases/tag/ImageElement-preview-2).

INSTALL THIS WITH CAUTION. THE FILE FORMAT WILL CHANGE. I SUGGEST YOU DO NOT USE IT IN YOUR MAIN VAULT.

This is a demo release. While I have played with this version for a good half-day, and haven't noticed any significant issues, please keep in mind, that I have built this demo version of Excalidraw-Obsidian using the unfinished/development version of the Excalidraw Image Element source code (https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/4011). Please make sure you back up your vault before installing this. However unlikely, it may also happen, that the file format of the final version changes, in which case you may lose some (or all) of your drawings edited with this version of Excalidraw.
