## New Feature
- Added setting to disable autosave, or to set autosave to a less frequent schedule. This is based on some discussion on issue [#401](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/401)
- Allow any precision when zooming ([4730](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/4730))
- Updated scripts: [Add Link to Existing File and Open](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Add%20Link%20to%20Existing%20File%20and%20Open.md) and [Add Link to New Page and Open](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Add%20Link%20to%20New%20Page%20and%20Open.md). The scripts will now group the link with the object. Also, the link circle object is now only 5% opaque.
