## New Feature
- Implemented basic word wrapping for embedded text. This partially resolves: [#118](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/118) 
  Include max line length after transclusion in curly brackets: `![[File#^blockref]]{40}`
  This example will wrap text to achieve max 40 characters per line.
