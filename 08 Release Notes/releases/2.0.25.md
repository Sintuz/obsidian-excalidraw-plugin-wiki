## New - a small change that opens big opportunities
- You can now set a folder as the Excalidraw Template in settings (See under Basic). If a folder is provided, Excalidraw will treat drawings in that folder as templates and will prompt you to select the template to use for new drawings.
- I updated the <a href="https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Deconstruct%20selected%20elements%20into%20new%20drawing.md">Deconstruct Selected Elements into new Drawing</a> script to accommodate the new template setting.
