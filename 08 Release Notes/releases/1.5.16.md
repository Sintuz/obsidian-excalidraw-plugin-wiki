## Fixed
- Issues with saving settings
- Script Engine did not handle folder name errors well, causing it to crash and not restart. I added more thorough error-checking logic to the script engine
- [#4533](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/4533) prefer spreadsheet data over the image

# New Feature
- #347: I added a parameter to ea.addElementsToView to specify whether new elements created with EA should be added at the back or the front of already existing elements in the View. Default is to add elements to the back.
```typescript
    async addElementsToView(
      repositionToCursor: boolean = false,
      save: boolean = true,
      newElementsOnTop: boolean = false
    ): Promise<boolean>
```
