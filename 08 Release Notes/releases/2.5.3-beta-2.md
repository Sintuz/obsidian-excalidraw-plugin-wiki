Everything in 2.5.3-beta-1 +

- Updated CN translation 🙏@dmscode
- New RU translation 🙏@tovBender

## Fonts: 
- Fixed [#8677](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/8677) Lilita an Nunito fonts did not appear in exports if ExcaliFont was also present in the scene
- Locally hosted font support is not yet working (likely won't by 2.5.3 release... it is beyond my "paygrade", can't seem to find a simple & workable solution).
  - Base Excalidraw fonts are included in the package
  - CJK font is loaded from the web
