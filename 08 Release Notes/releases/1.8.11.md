# New
- Support for referencing images from the internet in Excalidraw drawings, including YouTube thumbnail support. [#913](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/913)
  - Link to images on the internet without creating a copy in the Obsidian Vault by holding down the CTRL button while dropping the link or image.
  - Automatic conversion of image URLs and YouTube links into image elements with original links added as a link on the element when pasting. Note, that if you only want to paste the link, first double-click the canvas to start a new text element, then paste the link.
- Two new options added to plugin settings:
  - Make mouse wheel zoom by default [#474](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/474)
  - Allow pinch zoom in pen mode [#828](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/828)
- Update to the [Set Grid](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Set%20Grid.svg) script now saves the grid setting for the current file.
