## New
- In Miscellaneous Settings: added **Load Excalidraw Properties into Obsidian Suggester**. This setting toggles the automatic loading of Excalidraw properties at startup. Enabled by default for easy use of front matter properties. Disabling it prevents auto-loading, but you'll need to manually remove unwanted properties using Obsidian properties view. A plugin restart is required after enabling auto-loading.

## Fixed
- Zotero support [1835](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1835)
- Lines binding to elements and selections [#8146](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/8146), and plugin getting stuck with dragging an element [#8131](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/8131)
