Minor update:

## Fixes
- Color picker hotkeys were not working. They are working again [627](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/627)
- MathJax was throwing an error when you opened a drawing with LaTeX formulas. I updated MathJax (LaTeX) to the newest  (3.2.1) release.
