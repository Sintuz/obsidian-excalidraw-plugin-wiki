## Fixed:
- This update will patch existing Excalidraw files in your vault to correct formatting issues. The script will run in the background a few minutes after you've started obsidian. It will amend the malformed (yet working) Excalidraw .md files. Amongst others, this will improve the performance of hover previews of Excalidraw files.
- There were cases when settings did not save your changes consistently. Should be fixed.
- There was a race condition auto-generating SVG and PNG files. This led to files sometimes not being updated. 
- If the very first text element added to a drawing was a link, Excalidraw did not processes it well. 
- #111: Excalidraw now correctly treats Windows (CRLF), Linux (LF), and Mac (CR) line endings
- New drawings had comments (`%%`) misplaced, impacting tasks and links in text elements. Fixed.
- In some cases, the drawing stayed open in the view after deletion.
- open-drawing, insert-drawing, and insert-link dialogs were slow on large vaults. Speed is now improved. Tooltip was added each time the dialog was opened, leading to a long trail of tooltips after many uses.
- When opening a corrupted excalidraw file, the plugin will display an error message and open the file in markdown view. In the past, the file was sometimes overwritten with the previous active drawing.

# New feature:
- [#149](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/149) You can specify in settings if you want to embed PNG, SVG or Excalidraw files into documents.
