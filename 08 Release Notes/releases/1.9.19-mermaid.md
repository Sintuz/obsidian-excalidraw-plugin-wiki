# New
- Fourth Font now also supports fonts in OTF format
- Mermaid support, including ExcalidrawAutomate support for mermaid.

sample EA code:
```js
ea = ExcalidrawAutomate();
ea.setView();
await ea.addMermaid(
  `flowchart TD
    A[Christmas] -->|Get money| B(Go shopping)
    B --> C{Let me think}
    C -->|One| D[Laptop]
    C -->|Two| E[iPhone]
    C -->|Three| F[fa:fa-car Car]`
);
ea.addElementsToView();
```

# Fixed
-  re-colorMap map (see [1.9.19](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/releases/tag/1.9.19) for more info) did not work when either of the fill or stroke color properties of the image was missing.
