## New
- Text Element cursor color matched the text color.
- Diagnostics to analyze startup time. After Obsidian has loaded open Developer Console (CTRL+SHIFT+i / CMD+OPT+i) and type the following `ExcalidrawAutomate.printStartupBreakdown()`
- [Image Occlusion](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Image%20Occlusion.md) script by [@TrillStones](https://github.com/TrillStones) üôè

## Fixed
- BUG: icon on the ribbon menu keeps reappearing even if you hide it every time you reopen Obsidian [#2115](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2115)
- In pen mode, when single-finger panning is enabled, allow actions with the mouse.
- When editing an Excalidraw file in split mode (drawing on one side, markdown view on the other), editing the markdown sometimes causes the drawing to re-zoom and jump away from the selected area.
- Hover-Editor compatibility
-  `ExcalidrawAutomate.create()` will now correctly include the markdown text in templates above Excalidraw Data and below YAML front matter. This also fixes the same issue with the Deconstruct Selected Element script.
