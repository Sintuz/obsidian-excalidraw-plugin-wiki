## New
- **QoL improvements**:
  - Obsidian-link search button in Element Link Editor.
  - Add Any File now searches file aliases as well.
  - Cosmetic changes to file search modals (display path, show file type icon).
  - Text Element cursor-color matches the text color.
- New script in script store: [Image Occlusion](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Image%20Occlusion.md) by [@TrillStones](https://github.com/TrillStones) üôè

## Fixed
- Excalidraw icon on the **ribbon menu kept reappearing** every time you reopen Obsidian [#2115](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2115)
- In pen mode, when **single-finger panning** is enabled, Excalidraw should still **allow actions with the mouse**.
- When **editing a drawing in split mode** (drawing is on one side, markdown view is on the other), editing the markdown note sometimes causes the drawing to re-zoom and jump away from the selected area.
- Hover-Editor compatibility resolved [2041](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2041)
- `ExcalidrawAutomate.create()` will now correctly include the markdown text in templates above Excalidraw Data and below YAML front matter. This also **fixes the same issue with the Deconstruct Selected Element script**.
