- This is a big update that accommodates the **UI redesign** on Excalidraw.com [#5780](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5780). The change on the surface may seem superficial, however, I had to tweak a number of things to make it work in Obsidian. I hope I found everything that broke and fixed it, if not, I'll try to fix it quickly...
- This update also comes with changes under the hood that **fix issues with Excalidraw Automate** - paving the way for further scripts, plus some smaller bug fixes.
- I **reworked text wrapping**. In some cases, text wrapping in SVG exports looked different compared to how the text looked in Excalidraw. This should now be fixed.
- If you are using the **Experimental Dynamic Styling** of the Excalidraw Toolbar, then I recommend updating your styling script following base on [this](https://gist.github.com/zsviczian/c7223c5b4af30d5c88a0cae05300305c)
