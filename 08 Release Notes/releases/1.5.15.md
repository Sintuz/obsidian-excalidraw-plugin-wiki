## New Feature
- [#344](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/344) Experimental immersive image embedding in Live Preview editing mode. Enabled by default. If it is causing errors, please let me know via issues. You can turn the feature off in settings (at the very bottom of the Excalidraw settings)
- Implemented automated notification when a new version of Excalidraw is available.
- Added ability to save settings to scripts. There is one new property and 2 new functions on ExcalidrawAutomate:
```typescript
  activeScript: string;
  getScriptSettings(): {};
  async setScriptSettings(settings:any):Promise<void>;
```
Excalidraw script engine will automatically set activeScript to the value representing the currently executing script. Settings are saved into excalidraw-obsidian data.json together with other Excalidraw plugin settings.
