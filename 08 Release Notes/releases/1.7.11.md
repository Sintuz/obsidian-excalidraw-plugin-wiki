## Fixed
- Markdown files embed into the Excalidraw canvas crashed when the embedded markdown file included a nested Markdown embed with a block reference (i.e. the markdown document you are dropping into Excalidraw included a quote you referenced from another file using a `[[other-file#^blockref]]` block or section reference. 
- Horizontal flipping of arrows and lines broke in 1.7.10. ([#726](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/726))
