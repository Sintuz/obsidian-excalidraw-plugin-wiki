## New
- Changed behavior: In the Obsidian markdown editor clicking an Excalidraw image will not open the image (to avoid accidentally opening the image on a tablet). To open a drawing for editing in Excalidraw double click or long-tap on it. [#920](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/920)

## Fixed 
- BUG: text stroke color is not honored when the color is not on the palette [#921](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/921)
- BUG: The new [paste behavior](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5786) introduced in the previous release did not work as expected in Obsidian. Now it does.
