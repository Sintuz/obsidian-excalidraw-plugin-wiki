## Fixed
- A problem where switching between two Excalidraw documents in the same tab could result in the content from the first document overwriting the second one, particularly when the first document was large. [#1988](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1988)
- Styling issue when Obsidian font size is set to the non-default value.
- Embedding a block reference `![[file#^block]]` where the file is an excalidraw file incorrectly replaced the embedding with the image instead of the block of text.

## New
- Improved SVG export to include only the necessary glyphs for .woff2 fonts, minimizing file sizes. Note that this feature is currently supported only for .woff2 files; other font formats like .ttf and .otf will be fully embedded, leading to larger SVG files. I recommend using .woff2 files whenever possible.
