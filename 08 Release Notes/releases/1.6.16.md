![Excalidraw 1 6 16 Release Notes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14358394/155894422-cffcf247-9601-43ec-8a8d-53b61ad6ef4c.png)

## Fixed
- CMD+Drag from the Obsidian File Manager does not work on Mac. You can now use SHIFT+Drag to embed an image or markdown document into a scene. ([#468](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/468))
- Excalidraw Compressed JSON is now cut to smaller chunks (64 characters per paragraph, instead of the earlier 1024 characters). This should address search performance issues. ([#484](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/484))

## New Features
- I added the Obsidian Tools Panel
  - Click the Obsidian button to access the panel.
  - The tools panel contains key plugin commands and user / downloaded Excalidraw scripts.
  - Drag the panel with the handle at the top. A single click on the top to collapse the panel.
  - On Mobile press and hold the drag handle before dragging, to avoid activating the Obsidian slide-in menus.
  - On Mobile long touch individual buttons on the panel to access tooltips.
  - Reinstall Excalidraw scripts to get the icons.
- If you hold down SHIFT while resizing a sticky note, the text size will scale instead of text wrapping. ([Excalidraw tweet](https://twitter.com/aakansha1216/status/1496116528890417155?s=20&t=taXjA6I9Nd0T-C0wYBsG5g))
- SVG export now includes links ([#4791](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/4791))
- Added fullscreen mode for Obsidian Mobile
- Release notes
  - disable popup in settings
  - access release notes via the command palette, or the button on the tools panel
