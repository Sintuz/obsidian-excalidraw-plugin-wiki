## New from Excalidraw.com:
- Show a mid-point for lines and arrows. By touching the mid-point you can add an additional point to a two-point line. This is especially helpful when working on a tablet with touch input. ([#5534](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5534))
- Lock angle when editing a line or an arrow with shift pressed. Pressing shift will restrict the edited point to snap to certain discrete angles. ([#5527](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5527))

# Fixed:
- Clicking Obsidian search-results pointing to an element on the canvas stopped working ([#734](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/734))
- Allow resizing and rotation of lines and arrows consisting of 3 or more points by showing the bounding box when selected ([#5554](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5554))

# New
- You can now use the following frontmatter key to allow/prevent automatic export of PNG/SVG images at a file level. This frontmatter will override export settings for the given file.  ([#732](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/732)
