## Fixed:
- When moving a group of objects on the grid, each object snapped separately resulting in a jumbled-up image [#7082](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/7082)

## New from Excalidraw.com:
- Laser Pointer. Press "K" to activate the laser pointer, or find it under more tools. In View-Mode double click/tap the canvas to toggle the laser pointer
