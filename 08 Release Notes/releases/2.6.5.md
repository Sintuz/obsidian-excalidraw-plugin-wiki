## Fixed
- Text sizing issue in the drawing that is first loaded after Obsidian restarts [#2086](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2086)
- Excalidraw didn't load if there was a file in the Excalidraw folder with a name that starts the same way as the Scripts folder name. [#2095](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2095)
- **OVERSIZED EXCALIDRAW TOOLBAR**: Added a new setting under "Excalidraw Appearance and Behavior > Theme and Styling" called "Limit Obsidian Font Size to Editor Text." This setting is off by default. When enabled, it restricts Obsidian’s custom font size adjustments to editor text only, preventing unintended scaling of Excalidraw UI elements and other themes that rely on the default interface font size. Feel free to experiment with this setting to improve Excalidraw UI consistency. However, because this change affects the broader Obsidian UI, it’s recommended to turn it off if any layout issues arise. [#2087](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2087)
