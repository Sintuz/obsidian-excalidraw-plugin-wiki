## Fixed
- removed targetView.save() from deleteViewElements() as that was causing issues when executing the script

# New Feature:
- Added suggester to Script Engine utils.
  - `suggester: (displayItems: string[], actualItems: string[])`
    - Opens a suggester. Displays the displayItems, but you map these the other values with actual Items. Returns the selected value.
    - You need to await the result of suggester.
