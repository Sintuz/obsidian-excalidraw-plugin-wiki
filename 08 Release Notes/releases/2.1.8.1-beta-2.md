Files you save with 2.2.0 are not backward compatible with earlier versions of the plugin!

# New
- File format. I nested all Excalidraw markup under `# Excalidraw Data`.  Here's the new structure.
```markdown
---
excalidraw-plugin: parsed
other-frontmatter-properties: values
---
back of the note bla bla bla

# Excalidraw Data
## Text Element
## Element Links
## Embedded Files
%%
## Drawing
%%
```
- When opening Excalidraw in Markdown `# Excalidraw Data` will be folded.
- New command palette action: `Open the back-of-the-note of the selected Excalidraw image`. The action is only visible when you have an embedded Excalidraw drawing selected in your Excalidraw scene. The command will open the back of the selected card in a popout window on Desktop, and in a new tab on mobile.
