## New
- embed PDF

## New in ExcalidrawAutomate
- onFileCreateHook: if set this hook is called whenever a new drawing is created using Excalidraw command palette menu actions. If the excalidraw file is created using Templater or other means, the trigger will not fire. [#1124](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1124)
```typescript
  onFileCreateHook: (data: {
    ea: ExcalidrawAutomate;
    excalidrawFile: TFile; //the file being created
    view: ExcalidrawView;
  }) => Promise<void>;
```

## Fixed
- Embedded images, markdowns, PDFs will load one by one, not in one go after a long wait
- minor styling improvement to dynamic styling
