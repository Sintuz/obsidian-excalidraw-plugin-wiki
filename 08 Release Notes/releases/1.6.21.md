 # Fixed
- Links in drawings (e.g. text elements, embedded images, etc) were not updating consistently when the source file was moved or renamed in your Vault. In some cases, this has led to broken links.
- I implemented further improvements to the saving of your drawings. To remove an element of complexity and potential error, as part of this change, I have hidden the autosave settings. From now, autosave is always enabled. Excalidraw will attempt to save at every 10s, or if you are actively engaged in drawing a shape at that very moment (e.g. you are busy with a freedraw line), then autosave will save the drawing at the earliest next opportunity. Though this should never happen, if for some reason the save button gets stuck on "red" you should press it to trigger a forced-save.
- If you have two sections in your drawing `# Section abc` and `# Section abc def`, then referencing `[[#Section abc]]` in a link will also highlight `# Section abc def`. These section references now work as expected.
