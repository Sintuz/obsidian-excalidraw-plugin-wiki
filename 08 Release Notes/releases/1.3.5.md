## New features:
- added a check at plugin startup to validate Electron version. Excalidraw will display a message if Electron version is "8." as I had multiple cases when users complained that Excalidraw does not work for them, and it turned out they were using an old version of Electron (Obsidian installer).
- Added forceViewMode option to ExcalidrawAutomate.viewToggleFullScreen()
