# New
- Deployed sidebar for libraries panel from excalidraw.com ([#5274](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5274)). You can dock the library to the right side depending on the screen real estate available (i.e. does not work on mobiles).

# Fixed
- When copying 2 identical images from one drawing to another, the second image got corrupted in the process ([#672]https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/672)).
- When making a copy of an equation in a drawing and then without first closing/opening the file, immediately copying the new equation to another drawing, the equation did not get displayed until the file was closed and reopened.
- Copying a markdown embed from one drawing to another, in the destination the markdown embed appeared without the section/block reference and without the width & height (i.e. these settings had to be done again)
- Improved the parsing of section references in embeds. When you had `&` in the section name in a markdown file, when embedding that markdown document into Excalidraw, the section reference did not work as expected ([#681 ](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/681)).
- Improved the logic for autosave to better detect changes to the document, and to reduce too frequent export of `.png` and/or `.svg` files, when auto export is enabled in plugin settings.
