## Refactoring
- Obsidian 1.8.x will likely include a new version of Mermaid. Unfortunately that breaks the current Mermaid-to-Excalidraw feature that uses the built in Obsidian Mermaid package to save memory and improve the startup time of the plugin. To ensure longevity of the plugin I stopped using the Obsidian version of Mermaid and use the one that comes with Excalidraw. Side Effect is that Excalidraw main.js has increased to 9.2MB and startup time increases with a few percent. The benefit is all the fixes and improvements to mermaid in Excalidraw since January 2024 that I haven't deployed to Obsidian become available. In short, for the end user this is likely an invisible change, under the hood lots have changed.
