## Fixed: Text wrapping issue in sticky notes. Text wraps differently and words disappear during text editing. (#6318)

There are 3 additional issues with container text editing open. I hope they will be addressed soon. Excalidraw.com recently changed how text size is calculated, and unfortunately, this has a knock-on effect on Obsidian (as this time I was too quick to follow excalidraw.com developments - sorry). The related issues still open are:
- Pinch zooming while editing text in a text container [#6331](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/6331)
- Container text jumps on edit on Android with on-screen keyboard [#6330](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/6330)
- Shadow text when editing text containers without a keyboard on iOS [#6329](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/6329)
