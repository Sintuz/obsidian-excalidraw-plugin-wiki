## New
- Embed scene in exported PNG and SVG images [#860](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/860).  This means that the export will be a normal PNG or SVG image with the added functionality that if someone loads the image into excalidraw.com it will open as a normal excalidraw file.
  - I've added 2 new Command Palette actions (export PNG, export SVG with embedded scene).
  - If you SHIFT click `Save as PNG (or SVG)` in the workspace-tab menu, Excalidraw will embed the scene in the export.
- I updated the [Organic Line](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Organic%20Line.md)  script. It has an improved thick-to-thin look and a new thin-to-thick-to-thin line type.
- The plugin now includes support for [Perfect Freehand](https://perfect-freehand-example.vercel.app/) pen-options. I've also added a new [Alternative Pens](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Alternative%20Pens.md) script.

# Fixed
- Intelligent image width setting [#955](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/955). Before this change, when the embedded image was small, the image would be extended to meet the image width setting in plugin settings. From now on, if the image is smaller than max-width, it will only extend to max-width. You can still set 100% width using custom CSS. See more on that [here](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin#embedded-images).

# New in ExcalidrawAutomate
- I added the `plaintext` parameter to `ExcalidrawAutomate.create`. Using this, you can add some text below the frontmatter but above the `# Text Elements` section. Use this for example to add metadata to your file. (e.g. I use this in my Daily Quote template to add a Dataview field for the `Author::` and add the quote with a standard block reference, so I can easily reference it in other files. I also add the `#quote` tag to the file using this.)
- The script running in the ScriptEngine now also receives the `TFile` object for the script itself. You can access this object during execution via the `utils.scriptFile` variable.
