## New Features:
- Using iframely to resolve url titles when a URL is dropped onto a drawing. You can turn this feature off in settings.
- Includes the new arrow type from Excalidraw.com
- New command palette option to add an image from the vault

# Fix
- Markdown view performance was dreadful in case a large image was added to the drawing (and there were only very few elements in the drawing). This was because the svg snapshot includes a blob copy of the image, and markdown view struggled with lines of 1-2MB in size. I now cut the blob with \n after 4kb. For portability, the \n characters need to be removed before reusing the SVG.
