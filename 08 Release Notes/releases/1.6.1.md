Here's a demo of the new handwriting / linking features: https://youtu.be/_GfWailVKpc

# Fixes:
- Number of small QoL improvements to improve the pen experience 
  - iOS scribble now works with Excalidraw: [4705](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/4705)
  - Slow freedraw lines now will have less jitter [4726](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/4726)
  - Disabled three-finger pinch-zoom in pen mode as this was causing "jump" in some cases [4725](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/4725)
  - Freedraw generates much fewer points, resulting in smoother, faster pen strokes [4727](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/4727)

# New features:
- Option to enable hover preview in Excalidraw without needing to press CTRL/CMD

- ExcalidrawAutomate Script Engine `utils.inputPrompt` can now display multiple buttons (options)
```typescript
inputPrompt: (header: string, placeholder?: string, value?: string, buttons?: [{caption:string, action:Function}])
```
example:
```typescript
let fileType = "";
const filename = await utils.inputPrompt (
  "Filename for new document",
  "Placeholder",
  "DefaultFilename.md",
  [
    {
      caption: "Markdown",
      action: ()=>{fileType="md";return;}
		},
    {
      caption: "Excalidraw",
      action: ()=>{fileType="ex";return;}
    }
  ]
);
```
