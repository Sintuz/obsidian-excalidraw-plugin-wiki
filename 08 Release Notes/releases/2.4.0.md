## Notice
There is a minor formatting issue when you set non-default font size in `Obsidian > Appearance` settings. I won't publish an update just because of this. If you are impacted, you can add the following CSS snippet under `Obsidian > Appearance > CSS Snippets`. Open the folder, create a file e.g. "`excalidraw-style-tweak.css`" and paste the below code save the file, update the list of snippets in Obsidian and enable this new snippet.

```css
.excalidraw div[data-radix-popper-content-wrapper] > div > div.Island {
 max-width: 13rem !important;
}

.excalidraw .App-menu__left {
  width: 12.5rem !important;
}
```
