- Fourth Font now also supports fonts in OTF format

- Holding down CTRL/CMD while drawing or moving a shape with Grid turned on will disable snap to grid [#6983](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6983)
- Shape [Boolean Operations](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Boolean%20Operations.md) script in script library 🙏@GColoy
- Updated ribbon button logo to new Excalidraw logo

## Fixed
- Fourth Font displays correctly in SVGNative mode
- re-colorMap map (see [1.9.19](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/releases/tag/1.9.19) for more info) did not work when either of the fill or stroke color properties of the image was missing.
- Excalidraw's native eyedropper fixes [#7019](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7019)

## New in Excalidraw Automate
- `getPolyBool()` returns a [PolyBool](https://github.com/velipso/polybooljs) object
- sample mermaid code:
```js
ea = ExcalidrawAutomate();
ea.setView();
await ea.addMermaid(
  `flowchart TD
    A[Christmas] -->|Get money| B(Go shopping)
    B --> C{Let me think}
    C -->|One| D[Laptop]
    C -->|Two| E[iPhone]
    C -->|Three| F[fa:fa-car Car]`
);
ea.addElementsToView();
```
