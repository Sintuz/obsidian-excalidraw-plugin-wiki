## New
- create flowcharts from a generic element using elbow arrows  [#8329](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8329)
  - With the addition of elbow arrows, we now support the creation of a flowchart from a selected generic element with **Ctrl/Cmd + arrow key**
  -  Once a flowchart has been created, from any one of the nodes, we can navigate the flowchart using **Alt/Option + arrow key**
  - Additionally, holding Ctrl/Cmd and pressing the arrow key n times will create n nodes in the given direction at once when the starting node has multiple nodes connected to it, holding Alt/Option and pressing the arrow key will cycle between the connected nodes, giving users a chance to navigate to any one node in a flowchart
