Fixed
- Command Palette and Excalidraw Script Engine dialogs will show correctly when Excalidraw is in full-screen mode
- ExcalidrawAutomate now includes containerBound text element in getViewSelectedElements() when container is selected
- ExcalidrawAutomate: markdown links do not get lost when drawing is in parsed mode, and elements are edited using copyViewElementsToEAforEditing() and then added back into the canvas.

New feature:
- #321: Aliases are added to the suggestion list when inserting wikilink using the command palette
