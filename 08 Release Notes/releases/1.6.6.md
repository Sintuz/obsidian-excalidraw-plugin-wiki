## New features:
- I added two features to resolve [#418](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/418) 
  - Below 100% zoom level, link icon size is adaptive. As the image size decreases, so will link icons. Above 100% the link Icon size is fixed.
  - I added a setting where you can change the opacity of the link icon

- I added a button to finalize editing of a multi-point line element (notice the "check-mark" button appear in the bottom left as I start drawing the line). You can initiate a multi-point line with two fingers on a touchscreen and continue adding points until you finalize the line by pressing the "check-mark".
