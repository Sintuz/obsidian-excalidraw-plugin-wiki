Fixed:
- Excalidraw preview in live edit mode of a markdown document displayed transcluded files within the Excalidraw drawing as separate files. i.e. the image and then below the image the transcluded files. When the transcluded file did not exist, the markdown postprocessor threw an error. I added lots of additional comments to the markdownPostProcessor script and refactored/simplified the code slightly.
- Markdown embeds did not show when the embedded file is empty. Now Excalidraw will display a holding message until the document has content.
