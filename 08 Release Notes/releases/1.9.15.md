## New
- There is now a search box in the Excliadraw Script Store. I categorized the scripts and added keywords to help easier navigation.

## Fixed
- The theme of the embedded Markdown document did not always honor plugin settings. With some themes, it worked, with others (including the default Obsidian theme, it didn't).
