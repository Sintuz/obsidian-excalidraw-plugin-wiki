Bumping the version to 2.1.0 due to minor file format changes that aren't backward compatible. Essentially, 2.0.26 is already not backward compatible, but I forgot to update the version number.

If you haven't watched the [walkthrough video](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY) for 2.0.26, I recommend you do so.

## New
- Settings under `Excalidraw Appearance and Behavior`

  - Set the time delay for long press to open drawings from markdown under "Link Click and Modifier Keys".
