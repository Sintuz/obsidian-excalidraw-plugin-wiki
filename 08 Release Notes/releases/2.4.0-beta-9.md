## Fixed
- The drawing did not save the type of arrow. e.g. if you were using elbow arrows, the next time you opened the drawing you had to select elbow arrows again.

## New
- CTRL+F search in Excalidraw will also search in image file names

## Performance
- Performance improvement for drawing freedraw lines hopefully results in significant improvement for drawings with many elements.

## Refactor
- Excalidraw.com refactored the "Diagram to Code" AI feature. Hopefully, it will still work the same way it did before.
