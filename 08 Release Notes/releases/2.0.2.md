## Fixed
- Resolved an issue where the Command Palette's "Toggle between Excalidraw and Markdown mode" failed to uncompress the Excalidraw JSON for editing.

## New
- Scaling feature for embedded objects (markdown documents, pdfs, YouTube, etc.): Hold down the SHIFT key while resizing elements to adjust their size.

- Added new functionalities to the active embeddable top-left menu:
  - Document Properties (cog icon)
    - File renaming
    - Basic styling options for embedded markdown documents
    - Setting YouTube start time
  - Zoom to full screen for PDFs
- Improved immersive embedding of Excalidraw into Obsidian Canvas.
- Introduced new Command Palette Actions:
  - Embeddable Properties
  - Scaling selected embeddable elements to 100% relative to the current canvas zoom.
