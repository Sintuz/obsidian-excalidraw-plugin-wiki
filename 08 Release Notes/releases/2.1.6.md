## Two minor fixes
- Fixed scaling of LaTeX formulas when the formula is changed [#1724](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1724)
- Resolving an odd issue that has been there since November 2021 (v1.4.9). If the back of the note card only contains a block embed `![[embed]]` this was removed when saving the Excalidraw file.
