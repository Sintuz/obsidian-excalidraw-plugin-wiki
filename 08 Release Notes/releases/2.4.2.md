This release addresses critical issues for all Obsidian Mobile users.

#### I Made Two Mistakes
- **Rushed 2.4.1 fix:** I expedited the 2.4.1 release to resolve a major bug, but in doing so, I didn't conduct my usual level of thorough testing.
- **Premature feature inclusion:** I included a new feature from Excalidraw.com (SVG export to include only used glyphs) in 2.4.1, because I believe it brings significant end user benefits and did not want to wait until October. However, a small part of this feature was designed for server-side execution on Excalidraw.com, not for local use on Obsidian Mobile.

Despite these two emergency bug-fix releases, this doesn't deviate from the [monthly release schedule](https://youtu.be/2poSS-Z91lY). The next feature update is still planned for early October.

## Fixes:
- **Excalidraw rendering issues on Obsidian Mobile:**
  - Nested Excalidraw drawings with text failed to render.
  - Drawings in Markdown view didn't render if they contained text and were set to SVG Image or SVG Native (they worked with PNG).
  - SVG export failed for drawings containing text.
- **LaTeX equation duplication:** After using ALT+Drag to duplicate a LaTeX equation, editing the duplicate modified the original instead. [#1984](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1994)
- **Unreadable Obsidian search results:** When drawings contained numerous Element Links and Embedded Files Links, search results became unreadable. This fix will apply to files saved after installing the update. [#1999](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1999)
