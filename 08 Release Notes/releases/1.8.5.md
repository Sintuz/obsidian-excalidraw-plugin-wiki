## New from Excalidraw.com:
- Better default radius for rectangles [#5553](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5553)
  - old drawings will look unchanged, this applies only to new rectangles
> [!Note]- ExcalidrawAutomate technical details
> - `strokeSharpness` is now deprecated
> - use roundness instead
>    - `roundness === null` is legacy `strokeSharpness = "sharp"`
>    - `roundness = { type: RoundnessType; value?: number }
>      - type: 1, LEGACY, type:2 PROPORTIONAL_RADIUS, type:3 ADAPTIVE_RADIUS: 3
>      - value:
>        - Radius represented as % of element's largest side (width/height).
>          DEFAULT_PROPORTIONAL_RADIUS = 0.25;
>        - Fixed radius for the ADAPTIVE_RADIUS algorithm. In pixels.
>          DEFAULT_ADAPTIVE_RADIUS = 32;

## New
- Improved embedding into Obsidian Canvas
- Improved embedding into Markdown documents
- Added setting under `Display/Default mode when opening Excalidraw` to always open the drawing in view mode on Mobile, but in normal mode on desktop. [#939](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/939)

## Fixed
- Zoom reset tooltip appears twice [#942](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/942)
- Hid export library from library menu as it does not work due to Obsidian limitations. Use the command palette export library instead.
- Arrow with label did not get exported and embedded correctly [#941](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/941)
