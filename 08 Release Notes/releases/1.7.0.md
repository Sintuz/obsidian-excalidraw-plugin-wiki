This is the first test version of Excalidraw Obsidian supporting Obsidian 0.15.0 popout windows. The current technical solution is not really sustainable, it's more of a working concept. I don't expect any real big issues with this version - on the contrary, this works much better with Obsidian 0.15.0 popout windows, but some of the features aren't working as expected in the Obsidian popouts yet. Also as a consequence of Obsidian 0.15.0 compatibility, multiple hover previews are no longer supported.
