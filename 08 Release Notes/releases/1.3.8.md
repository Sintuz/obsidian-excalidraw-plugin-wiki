## New Features
- Navigating to block references (e.g. `![[document#^ref]]`) from the drawing will open the document at the position of the block reference.
- Extended ExcalidrawAutomate:
  - Improved calculation of line and arrow bounds.
  - New function: `addBlob(topX:number, topY:number, width:number, height:number):string;` will draw a blob which you can later alter by modifying the points of the blob
  - Extended function: with `wrapAt`, and different `box` type. If box is added, text will be centered in the box, also the text will be the top layer, thus if you add background color to the box, it will be behind the text.
  - Removed `verticalAlign` as it had no effect
```typescript
addText (
  topX:number, 
  topY:number, 
  text:string, 
  formatting?: {
    wrapAt?:number,
    width?:number, 
    height?:number,
    textAlign?: string, 
    box?: boolean|"box"|"blob"|"ellipse"|"diamond",
    boxPadding?: number
  },
  id?:string
):string;
```
