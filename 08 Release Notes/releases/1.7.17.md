## Fixed
- Block transclusions sometimes got lost when switching between RAW mode and PREVIEW mode. [#769](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/769)

## New
- Added feature to disable "new Excalidraw version" notification [#770](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/770)
- Added option to export both light- and dark-themed images at the same time. If this is enabled Excalidraw will create two files "filename.dark.png" and "filename.light.png" (or .svg depending on your other settings). See practical use case here: [Aadam's Notes](https://notes.aadam.dev/SBYNtPHqsTW9Ck1Kuoxsu/)
- Added custom export padding for PNG images. Use the frontmatter key `excalidraw-export-padding` to set the padding at a file level, or set padding for all your files in plugin settings. The new feature replaces the old "SVG Padding" option and applies to both SVG and PNG exports.

## ExcalidrawAutomate
- Added `padding` to the createPNG function call.
```typescript
async createPNG(
  templatePath?: string,
  scale: number = 1,
  exportSettings?: ExportSettings,
  loader?: EmbeddedFilesLoader,
  theme?: string,
  padding?: number,
)
```
