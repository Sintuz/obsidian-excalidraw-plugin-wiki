## New Feature
- Now you can copy a text element that has a link, and it will retain the link. This resolves issue [#114](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/114). Note that this feature only works with text created in 1.3.14. As a workaround for old drawings, simply double-click to edit "old" text before copying. New drawings will simply have this feature. I hope this "hassle" of double-clicking will fade over time, as more of your drawings are created/edited the newer version.

# Workaround for issue [#150](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/150)
- There is an issue with the placing of text elements when editing in a high zoom in ratio. For now, I maximize the auto-zoom to 200%
