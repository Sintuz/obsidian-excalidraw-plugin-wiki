## Warning
This is a pre-release using the latest unreleased Excalidraw 0.7.0 package. Based on my testing experience, this is stable, but not production-ready until Excalidraw 0.7.0 is officially released. 

## Fixes
### Excalidraw 0.7.0 fixes
These issues in Excalidraw affected the usability of Excalidraw in Obsidian, namely:
- The keyboard event propagation issue that impacted other workspace leaves in Obsidian. See bugs [#11](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/11) and [#12](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/12).
- Solves the ctrl+x on workspace leaf title issue
- The issue with placing library items outside view. 
- The issue with placing charts generated from pasted data

### App logic fixes
- The positioning of the drawing is also fixed. Drawings should now always appear centered within the workspace canvas when opening.
- When closing a drawing, not switching to another document in the file view did not save the drawing. This is now fixed.
- Drawings are always initialized with the theme they were saved.
- Moved stencil library files to data.json in hopes that Obsidian sync will cover these in the future. (sorry, this may again impact the stencil library for those that used the previous test version)
- main.js filesize drastically reduced (especially compared to the first test version... from 12MB down to 560kb)

## Breaking change
Excalidraw 0.7.0 also introduces a breaking change in how client-side stencil libraries are handled. As a consequence items in your stencil library (But not the drawings saved in your vault!) will be lost. You will need to add library items again.
