## Fixed
- Shift+Click on an element link (i.e. a link attached to a rectangle, ellipse, etc) did not open the link in a new leaf (as it does when clicking a text element link).
- Clicking a link in a new leaf will make the leaf active and focused after the click. No further click is necessary to start editing the opened document.
- Using [hover-editor](https://github.com/nothingislost/obsidian-hover-editor), if you opened an Excalidraw drawing and dragged the editor to another location, the pointer in Excalidraw got misaligned with the actual mouse / pen location. Similarly, when rearranging workspace panes by dragging, Excalidraw lost pointer calibration.

## New Features
### From Excalidraw.com
- Element locking

### Plugin
- Any element that has a link, ctrl/cmd+clicking anywhere on the object will trigger the link action. You no longer have to go to the link icon. ([#541](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/541#issuecomment-1075578365))
