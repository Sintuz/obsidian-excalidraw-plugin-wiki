## Fixed
- help shortcuts are really hard to see [#1176](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1179)
- link icons not visible on elements after 1.9.5 release (reported on Discord)
- PDFs in iFrames will now respect `[[document.pdf#page=155]]` format
- Keyboard shortcuts were not working properly on external drop. Check [updated keyboard map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/excalidraw-modifiers.png)
