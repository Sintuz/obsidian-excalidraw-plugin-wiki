## Improvements
- I modified the behavior of Excalidraw text element links.
  - CTRL/META + CLICK a text element to open it as a link.
  - CTRL/META + ALT + CLICK to create the file (if it does not yet exist) and open it
  - CTRL/META + SHIFT + CLICK to open the file in a new pane
  - CTRL/META + ALT + SHIFT + CLICK to create the file (if it does not yet exist) and open it in a new pane
- I added a setting to limit link functionality to `[[valid Obsidian links]]` only. By default, the full text of a text element is treated as a link unless it contains a `[[valid internal link]]`, in which case only the `[[internal link]]` is used. The new setting may be beneficial if you want to avoid unexpected updates to text in your drawings. This may happen if a text element in a drawing accidentally matches a file in your vault, and you happen to rename or move that file. By limiting the link behavior to `[[valid internal links]]` only, these accidental matches can be avoided. This is not frequent but happened to me recently.
- LaTeX symbol support. I resolved issue [#75](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/75) by adding a new command palette option ("Insert LaTeX-symbol") to insert an expression containing a LaTeX symbol or a simple formula. Some symbols may not display properly using the "Hand-drawn" font. If that is the case try using the "Normal" or "Code" fonts.
