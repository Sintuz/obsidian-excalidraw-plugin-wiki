[![Thumbnail - 20240518 Excalidraw file structure (Custom)](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/assets/14358394/58e183d1-4ebc-4d6c-ae50-5a40270d24b4)](https://youtu.be/dV0NEOwn5NM)

⚠️⚠️⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE ⚠️⚠️⚠️
Files you save with 2.2.0 are not backward compatible with earlier plugin versions!

## New from excalidraw.com
- Wrapable text elements (without the need for transparent sticky notes!)

## New
- File format. I nested all Excalidraw markup under `# Excalidraw Data`.  Here's the new structure.
```markdown
---
excalidraw-plugin: parsed
other-frontmatter-properties: values
---
back of the note bla bla bla

# Excalidraw Data
## Text Element
## Element Links
## Embedded Files
%%
## Drawing
%%
```
- When opening Excalidraw in Markdown `# Excalidraw Data` will be folded.
- New command palette action: `Open the back-of-the-note of the selected Excalidraw image`. The action is only visible when selecting an embedded Excalidraw drawing in the Scene. On a desktop, the command will open the back of the selected card in a popout window, and on a mobile, in a new tab.

## Fixed
- Drag and drop from Finder/Explorer (OS external). Images will retain their filenames. PDFs will be imported to the Vault. [#1779](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1779)
