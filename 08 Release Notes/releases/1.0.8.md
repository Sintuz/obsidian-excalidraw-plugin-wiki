## Obsidian mobile v.0.0.18
- This is not part of the update, but fantastic news: Starting from the Obsidian mobile version v.0.0.18, Excalidraw works well on your Mobile.

## QoL improvements
- Adds context menu to File Explorer to create new drawings
- Adds a new command to the palette: “Transclude (embed) the most recently edited Excalidraw drawing”
- Automatically update file-links in transclusions when you rename or move your drawing
- Saves drawing and updates all active pre-views when drawing loses focus
- File is closed and removed when you select “Delete file” from more options
- Saves drawing when exiting Obsidian
- Fixes pen positioning bug with sliding panes after panes scroll

## ExcalidrawAutomte full Templater support
You now have ultimate flexibility over your Excalidraw templates using Templater. 
- Detailed documentation available [here](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/AutomateHowTo.md)
- I created few examples from the simple to the more complex
	- Simple use-case: Creating a drawing using a custom template and following a file and folder naming convention of your choice.
	- Complex use-case: Create a mindmap from a tabulated outline.

## Next update will concentrate on some minor known issues with Mobile
- Positioning of the pen gets misaligned with your stylus/finger after you open the command palette
- saving when you terminate the mobile app by closing the Obsidian task
