## Fixed
- Text size in sticky notes increased when opening the drawing or when editing a sticky note [#824](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/824)
- ToDo rendering did not work properly when there were parsed links in the text
- Horizontal text alignment in sticky notes did not honor text alignment setting when resizing text. The text was always aligned center even when text alignment was left or right. [#5720](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/5720)
