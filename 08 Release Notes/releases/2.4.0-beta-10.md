## Performance
- Moved the JSON compressor to a separate worker thread, reducing glitches in freedraw performance during autosave.
- Refactored JSON manipulation in the load and save functions, further decreasing freedraw performance glitches when autosave runs.

## Fixes
- Fixed two issues with pasting links and transclusions. These were not rendered correctly until the user pressed CTRL+S, and block references from the back-of-the-excalidraw file (i.e. self-references in the format of `![[#^blockRef]]` triggered a warning message.
- Resolved a bug that caused Excalidraw to erroneously switch to markdown view mode when clicking a link (e.g., in backlinks or search) that should lead to an embedded image in the drawing.

## New
- Pasting multiple lines of text with `CTRL+V` (not `CTRL+Shift+V`) now replaces any image embeds with actual images and shifts the pasted text downward to make room. This enables you to copy an entire markdown document and "convert" it into text elements and images in Excalidraw with a single `CTRL+V` action.
- Added Chinese ReadMe üôè@dmscode

## Housekeeping
- Refactored rollup.config.js and cleaned up/updated dependencies in package.json
