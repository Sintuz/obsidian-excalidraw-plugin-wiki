## New
- Pen-mode single-finger panning enabled also for the "Selection" tool.
- You can disable pen-mode single-finger panning in Plugin Settings under Excalidraw Appearance and Behavior [#2080](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2080)

## Fixed
- Text tool did not work in pen-mode using finger [#2080](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2080)
- Pasting images to Excalidraw from the web resulted in filenames of "image_1.png", "image_2.png" instead of "Pasted Image <<timestamp>>" [#2081](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2081)
