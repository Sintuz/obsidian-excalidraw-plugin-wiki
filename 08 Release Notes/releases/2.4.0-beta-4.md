## What to test
- Please test Excalidraw previews, publishing, markdown view, reading view, hover-preview, export to PDF... with all the different settings (e.g.: excalidraw-open-md: true).
- The change impacting `getViewSelectedElmenents` may have a broad range of effects. I know of some positive changes, such as the deconstruct elements script now correctly deconstructs framed elements, but I don't know if I have broken anything. This function is such a fundamental function that it can have effects in many places.

## New
- New setting in the PDF import process allows pages to be imported directly into frames instead of rectangles. This enhancement offers several advantages, image references can reference page numbers (e.g. referencing all annotations for page 3 would be `![[drawing#^frame=3]]`), you can crop PDF pages in place by resizing the frame, additionally, it simplifies moving, copying, or deconstructing pages along with their annotations.

## Fixed
- In the case of group references (i.e.: `![[drawing#^group=<groupID>]]`), if the group includes a frame, elements inside the frame will also be included in the group. 
- Frame and ClippedFrame reference will only be offered as options if one and only one frame is selected
- Improved markdown preview rendering speed especially in the case of PDF Exports [#1932](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1932)

## New in ExcalidrawAutomate
- `addElementsToFrame(frameId: string, elementIDs: string[]):void;`;

## Breaking change
- `getViewSelectedElements(includeFrameChildren: boolean = true): ExcalidrawElement[];`: if frames are selected the function will return the frames and all their child elements unless `includeFrameChildren` is set to false. Until now, the function did not return frame children, however, this behavior is inconsistent with the copy/paste experience.
