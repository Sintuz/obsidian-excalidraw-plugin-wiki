## New from Excalidraw.com
-  You can now set the text width even during creation. Simply drag with the text tool. Note, there's a minimum distance before the text enters the wrapped mode so there aren't false positives. [See example here](https://x.com/excalidraw/status/1795468201335075000)

## New
- Updated zh-cn translation. Thank you @dmscode 
- New context menu and command palette action: "Move back-of-note card to File". This is only active when an eligible embeddable element is selected.

## Fixed
- Setting different autosaveIntervals on Desktop and Mobile will no longer trigger unnecessary commits to settings each time you open Excalidraw on a different device. Thanks @jmhammond for the contribution!

## Fixed in ExcalidrawAutomate
- `getCM(color)` was missing from `ea.help()`. It is now added. getCM returns a ColorMaster object. ColorMaster is a powerful library should you want to create scripts to manipulate colors.
