## New
- Minor updates from [Excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com). The key change is text measurements that should result in consistent text sizing between desktop and mobile devices.
- Now you can embed the markdown section of an Excalidraw note to your drawing. Simply select `Insert ANY file`, choose the drawing, and select the relevant heading section to embed.
  - This also works with "back-of-the-drawing" markdown sections. Use the context menu `Add back-of-note Card`. The action is also available on the Command Palette and in the Excalidraw-Obsidian Tools Panel.
- Editing an embedded markdown note is now easier. Just press Enter when the element is selected. [#1650](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1650)
- The crosshair cursor is now hidden when the freedraw tool is active and using a pen. [#1659](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1659)
- `Convert markdown note to Excalidraw Drawing` now converts an existing markdown note (not just empty notes) into a drawing. The original markdown note will be on the "back side of the drawing".
- Introducing `Annotate image in Excalidraw`, which works very similarly to `Crop and mask image`. You can replace an image in a markdown note or on the Obsidian Canvas with an Excalidraw drawing containing that image. You will be able to annotate the image in Excalidraw.
- Now you can reference frames in images embedded in markdown and canvas with frame names e.g. `![[drawing#^frame=Frame 01]]`
- Excalidraw file format change:
  - New frontmatter switch `excalidraw-open-md`: If set to true, the file by default will open as a markdown file. You can switch to Excalidraw View Mode via the command palette action or by right-clicking the tab.
  - Easter Egg: If you add a comment in front of `# Text Elements`, then the entire Excalidraw data: markdown and JSON will be commented out, thus invisible when exporting to the web. If you remove the comment from before `# Text Elements`, then only the JSON will be commented out.
