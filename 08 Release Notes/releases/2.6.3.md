## New
- **Cropping PDF Pages**  
  - Improved PDF++ cropping: You can now double-click cropped images in Excalidraw to adjust the crop area, which will also appear as a highlight in PDF++. This feature applies to PDF cut-outs created in version 2.6.3 and beyond.
- **Insert Last Active PDF Page as Image**  
  - New command palette action lets you insert the currently active PDF page into Excalidraw. Ideal for setups with PDF and Excalidraw side-by-side. You can assign a hotkey for quicker access. Cropped areas in Excalidraw will show as highlights in PDF++.

## Fixed
- Fixed **Close Settings** button toggle behavior [#2085](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2085)
- Resolved text wrapping issues causing layout shifts due to trailing whitespaces [#8714](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8714)
- **Aspect Ratio and Size Reset** commands now function correctly with cropped images.
- **Cropped Drawings**: Adjustments to cropped Excalidraw drawings are now supported. However, for nested Excalidraw drawings, it's recommended to use area, group, and frame references instead of cropping.

## Refactoring
- Further font loading optimizations on Excalidraw.com; no impact expected in Obsidian [#8693](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8693)
- Text wrapping improvements [#8715](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8715)
- Plugin initiation and error handling
