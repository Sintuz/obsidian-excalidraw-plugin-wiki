## New features:
- I resolved issue [#78](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/78). When you CTRL-Click a grouped collection of objects Excalidraw will open the page based on the embedded text.
- I added a setting to disable the CTRL-click functionality should it interfere with default Excalidraw behavior for you. In my experience double-clicking achieves the same outcome as a CTRL-click on an element in a grouped collection of objects, but if you use the CTRL-click feature to select an element of a group frequently, and find the "CTRL-click to open a link" feature annoying, you can now disable it.
