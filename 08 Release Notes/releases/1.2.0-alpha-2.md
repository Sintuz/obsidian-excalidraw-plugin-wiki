I've released a newer version since. Please read the below notes, then move on to [Excalidraw 1.2.0 Alpha 4](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/releases/tag/1.2.0-alpha-4).

# bug fixes and new features
- delete .png and .svg when "keep in sync" is on, now works
- `*.excalidraw` export now generates a correct file, which will load on [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com)
- added to optional frontmatter switches to customize link prefix and brackets per drawing
  - `excalidraw-link-prefix: "ðŸ‘‰ "`
  - `excalidraw-link-brackets: true/false`
- changed default filename to `*.excalidraw.md` while excalidraw will work with any `*.md` files that has the `excalidraw-plugin` frontmatter key, keeping the file naming convention will ensure Ozan's Image in Editor continues to work.
- I refactored how event handlers are registered, de-registered (It turns out it was working correctly until now)
- I cleaned up the language file. Please contact me if you'd volunteer to translate the plugin to a language.
- I fixed templates in ExcalidrawAutomate
- ... and some other minor improvements
