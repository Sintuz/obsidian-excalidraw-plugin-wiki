## Fixed
- Adding images using the image tool in the toolbar was unreliable. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. (it depended on whether the drawing had changes or not. Autosave was causing the issue with the image tool). [#1992](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1992)
- Fixed issue where links to the back of the note were broken if (an unnamed) frame was in the scene. [#2027](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2027)
- Fixed issue with width, height, style parsing of embedded excalidraw drawings. `![[my file|10 - my alias]]` was incorrectly parsed as a width value of 10 and a style of "- my alias".
- False positive tag results in second order links list
- Selecting tag from list did not open the tag in search 

## New
- Excalidraw will save the image with the filename from the file system when adding the image via the image tool (in the top toolbar).
- Increased maximum image size from a max width/height of 1440 to 2880, when adding an image via the add image tool in the top toolbar.
