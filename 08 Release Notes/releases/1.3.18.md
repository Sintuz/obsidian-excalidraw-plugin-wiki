Updated Excalidraw component to the latest version. This includes a few minor enhancements.

# Fixed:
- in special situations link hover caused an error. Not any more.
- Link hover on drawings did not work correctly with rotated text elements. This is not corrected. Also if multiple text elements are available at the location of the pointer, Excalidraw will now select one that has a link.
