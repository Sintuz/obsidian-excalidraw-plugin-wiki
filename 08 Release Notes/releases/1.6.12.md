## Improvements
- Improved saving:
  - Added 15-second autosave option.
  - Excalidraw will not save the file if there aren't any changes
  - on Obsidian quit save trigger was removed, because it is executed by Obsidian on a best effort basis, and may not complete, leaving crippled files.
  - Save icon turns red if edits are found. Autosave clears the red.
  - Removed the saving of .bak files

- The custom color palette now supports any number of colors
- The mobile toolbar now includes the save link button
