## New and improved
- **Updated Chinese translation**. Thanks, @tswwe!
- **Improved update for TextElement links**: Until now, when you attached a link to a file to a TextElement using the "Create Link" command, this link did not get updated when the file was renamed or moved. Only links created as markdown links in the TextElement text were updated. Now both approaches work. Keep in mind however, that if you have a link in the TextElemenet text, it will override the link attached to the text element using the create link command. [#566](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/566)
- **Transclusion filters markdown comments**: Text transclusion in a TextElement using the `![[file]]` or `![[file#section]]` format did not filter out markdown comments in the file placed `%% inside a comment block %%`. Now they do.
- **Remove leading '>' from trancluded quotes**: Added a new option in settings under **Links and Transclusion** to remove the leading `> ` characters from quotes you transclude as a text element in your drawing.

- **Added support for `webp`, `bmp`, and `ico` images**. This extends the already supported formats (`jpg`, `gif`, `png`, `svg`).
- **Added command palette action to reset images to original size**. Select a single image or embedded Excalidraw drawing on your canvas and choose `Set selected image element size to 100% of original` from the command palette. This function is especially helpful when you combine atomic drawings on a single canvas, keeping each atomic piece in its original excalidraw file (i.e. the way I create [book on a page summaries](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6mqgtMZ4NP1-mbCYc3T7mr-unmsIXpEG))
- The `async getOriginalImageSize(imageElement: ExcalidrawImageElement): Promise<{width: number; height: number}>` function is also avaiable via ExcalidrawAutomate. You may use this function to resize images to custom scales (e.g. 50% size, or to fit a certain bounding rectangle).

# Fixed
- Upgraded perfect freehand package to resolve unwanted dots on end of lines [#5727](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5727)
- Pinch zoom in View mode opens images resulting in a very annoying behavior [#837](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/837)
- Embedded files such as transcluded markdown documents and images did not honor the Obsidian "New Link Format" setting (shortest path, relative path, absolute path). [#829](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/829)
- **Fixed error with dataview queries involving Excalidraw files**: In case you created a task on an Excalidraw canvas (`docA.md`) by typing `- [ ] Task [[owner]] #tag`, and then you created a Dataview tasklist in another document (`docB.md`) such that the query criteria matched the task in `docA.md`, then the task from `docA.md` only appeared as an empty line when viewing `docB.md`. If you now embedded `docB.md` into a third markdown document (`docC.md`), then instead of the contents of `docB.md` Obsidian rendered `docA.md`.
