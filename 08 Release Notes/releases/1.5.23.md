## New Features
## Pencil & Pen QoL improvements:
- Palm rejection: Introducing the pencil lock to prevent touch to interfere with your drawing with your Apple Pencil, or other stylus or pen. Click the freedraw tool and the lock will appear.

## Others
- [#396](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/396) Excalidraw file backup. A backup is created when saving your drawing. If the main drawing file is corrupted due to the unexpected shutdown of Obsidian, Excalidraw will first attempt to restore the drawing from the backup.
- [#395](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/395) Field Suggestor borrowed from Breadcrumbs and Templater plugins. The Field Suggestor will show an autocomplete menu with all available Excalidraw field options when you type `excalidraw-` or `ea.`. Tooltips offer helpful background information for ExcalidrawAutomate functions. You can turn this feature off under Experimental Settings.
