## Fixed
- Dragging multiple files onto the canvas will now correctly [#589](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/589)
  - add multiple links
  - or if you hold the CTRL/(SHIFT on Mac) while dropping the files, then adding multiple images
- Dropped images and links were not selectable with the selection tool until the file was saved. This is now fixed.
- Display the linked block/section on link-hover instead of the full page. [#597](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/597)
- Hover preview without CTRL/CMD works again. Requires configuration in plugin settings. [#595](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/595)
- If you embed the same markdown document into a drawing multiple times, you can now display different sections of the document in each embedded object. [#601](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/601).
- If you make a copy of an equation and edit this copy, the original equation will remain unchanged [#593](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/593)

## New Features
- When you drag files from Dataview-results onto the canvas the obsidian:// urls will be converted into wiki links.[#599](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/599)
- I added one more frontmatter key: `excalidraw-linkbutton-opacity:` This sets the opacity of the blue link-button in the top right corner of the element, overriding the respective setting in plugin settings. Valid values are numbers between 0 and 1, where 0 means the button is fully transparent.

### Excalidraw Automate and Plugin integration
- I added `app.plugins.plugins["obsidian-excalidraw-plugin"].getAPI()`. The function will generate a new instance of the ExcalidrawAutomate API interface. This provides an alternative to using `window.ExcalidrawAutomate` with the added benefit that you do not need to `reset()` the object each time you use it since this will be a dedicated instance created each time `getAPI()` is called. For general scripting purposes `window.ExcalidrawAutomate` is still the ideal solution, however, if you are building a plugin or more complex script against ExcalidrawAutomate, then this solution will have benefits.
- published npm package for Excliadraw so that plugins can be developed against the Excalidraw-Automate API
- New event hooks:
```typescript
  /**
   * Register instance of EA to use for hooks with TargetView
   * By default ExcalidrawViews will check window.ExcalidrawAutomate for event hooks.
   * Using this event you can set a different instance of Excalidraw Automate for hooks
   */
  registerThisAsViewEA: () => void;

  /**
   * If set, this callback is triggered, when the user changes the view mode.
   * You can use this callback in case you want to do something additional when the user switches to view mode and back.
   */
  onViewModeChangeHook: (isViewModeEnabled:boolean) => void = null;

   /**
   * If set, this callback is triggered, when the user hovers a link in the scene.
   * You can use this callback in case you want to do something additional when the onLinkHover event occurs.
   * This callback must return a boolean value.
   * In case you want to prevent the excalidraw onLinkHover action you must return false, it will stop the native excalidraw onLinkHover management flow.
   */
  onLinkHoverHook: (
    element: NonDeletedExcalidrawElement,
    linkText: string,
  ) => boolean = null;

   /**
   * If set, this callback is triggered, when the user click a link in the scene.
   * You can use this callback in case you want to do something additional when the onLinkClick event occurs.
   * This callback must return a boolean value.
   * In case you want to prevent the excalidraw onLinkClick action you must return false, it will stop the native excalidraw onLinkClick management flow.
   */
  onLinkClickHook:(
    element: ExcalidrawElement,
    linkText: string,
    event: MouseEvent
  ) => boolean = null;

  /**
   * If set, this callback is triggered, when Excalidraw receives an onDrop event. 
   * You can use this callback in case you want to do something additional when the onDrop event occurs.
   * This callback must return a boolean value.
   * In case you want to prevent the excalidraw onDrop action you must return false, it will stop the native excalidraw onDrop management flow.
   */
  onDropHook: (data: {
    ea: ExcalidrawAutomate;
    event: React.DragEvent<HTMLDivElement>;
    draggable: any; //Obsidian draggable object
    type: "file" | "text" | "unknown";
    payload: {
      files: TFile[]; //TFile[] array of dropped files
      text: string; //string
    };
    excalidrawFile: TFile; //the file receiving the drop event
    view: ExcalidrawView; //the excalidraw view receiving the drop
    pointerPosition: { x: number; y: number }; //the pointer position on canvas at the time of drop
