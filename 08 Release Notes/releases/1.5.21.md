## New Features
- Since 1.5.15 ScriptEngine Scripts may have settings. These settings are stored as part of plugin settings. From now, these settings may be edited by the user via the Obsidian plugin settings window. 
  - See an example use of the feature [here](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/docs/ExcalidrawScriptsEngine.md#add-box-around-selected-elements)
  - You can access settings for the active script using `ea.getScriptSettings()`, and store settings with `ea.setScriptSettings(settings:any)`
  - Rules for displaying script settings in plugin settings:
    - If the setting is a simple literal (boolean, number, string) these will be displayed as such in settings. The name of the setting will be the key for the value. 
    ```javascript
    ea.setScriptSettings({ 
      "value 1": true, 
      "value 2": 1,
      "value 3": "my string"
    })
    ```

    - If the setting is an object and follows the below structure then a description and a valueset may also be added for displaying plugin settings. Values may also be hidden using the `hidden` key.
    ```javascript
    ea.setScriptSettings({
       "value 1": {
        "value": true,
        "description": "This is the description for my boolean value"
      },
      "value 2": {
        "value": 1,
        "description": "This is the description for my numeric value"
      },
      "value 3": {
        "value": "my string",
        "description": "This is the description for my string value",
        "valueset": ["allowed 1","allowed 2","allowed 3"]
      },
      "value 4": {
        "value": "my value",
        "hidden": true
      }        
    });
    ```

- ScriptEngine suggester now includes optional hint and instructions
  `suggester: (displayItems: string[], items: any[], hint?: string, instructions?:Instruction[])`
  - Opens a suggester. Displays the displayItems and returns the corresponding item from items[].
  - You need to await the result of suggester.
  - If the user cancels (ESC), suggester will return `undefined`
  - Hint and instructions are optional.
  ```typescript
  interface Instruction {
    command: string;
    purpose: string;
  }
  ```
