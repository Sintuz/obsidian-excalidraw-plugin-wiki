## Performance
- Much faster plugin initialization. Down from 1000-3000ms to 100-300ms. According to my testing speed varies on a wide spectrum depending on device, size of Vault and other plugins being loaded. I measured values ranging from 84ms up to 782ms [#2068](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2068) 
- Faster loading of scenes with many embedded illustrations or PDF pages.
- SVG export results in even smaller files by further optimizing which characters are included in the embedded fonts. [#8641](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8641)

## New
- Image cropping tool. Double click the image to crop it. [#8613](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8613)
- Single finger panning in pen mode.
- Native handwritten CJK Font support [8530](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8530) 
  - Created a new **Fonts** section in settings. This includes configuration of the "Local Font" and downloading of the CJK fonts in case you need them offline.
- Option under **Appearance and Behavior / Link Click** to disable double-click link navigation in view mode. [#2075](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2075)
