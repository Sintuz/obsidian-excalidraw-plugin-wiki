- Improvements to links
  - #72: You can now use square brackets to denote links. i.e. the text element `Which are my [[favorite books]]?` will be a link to `favorite books.md`.
  - Square brackets can still be omitted if the entire text element is an internal link. i.e. the following two text elements `Check out the [[requirements specification]]!!` and `requirements specification` will both represent a link to `requirements specification.md`.
  - When files are moved/renamed in your vault, text elements that are recognized links will also get updated in your drawings.
  - I added a new command palette option to insert an internal link to a file in your vault into the active drawing. While a drawing is open press ctrl/cmd+p and select `Excalidraw: Insert link to file`.
- #70: I Added CTRL/CMD + hover quick preview for Excalidraw files. Resolves
