## Fixed
- Error when leaving fullscreen, if two Excalidraw drawings were open side by side
- Error when text element is not yet present in the underlying markdown document and a link-hover event is triggered
- Name of the command palette action to switch between RAW and PREVIEW mode, changed from LOCK/UNLOCK to RAW/PREVIEW.

# New
- Published `wrapText(text:string, lineLen:number):string` via ExcalidrawAutomate.
