## New 
- Significant performance improvements from Excalidraw.com
- When selecting a highlight in the Obsidian PDF editor and selecting "Copy as Quote" in the context menu, then paste this to Excalidraw, the text will arrive as a text element wrapped in a transparent sticky note with the link to the original highlight attached to the sticky note. You can override this behavior by SHIFT+CTRL/CMD pasting

## Fixed
- BUG: Image caching issue. Changes to the drawing do not reflect immediately in the note when re-opening the drawing [#1297](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1279)
- Removed underline from links in NativeSVG embed.
