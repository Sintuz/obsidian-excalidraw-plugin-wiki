## Fixed:
- Performance of the Markdown view when working with large drawings was significantly improved. The plugin now exports formatted Excalidraw JSON which works better with  CodeMirror in Obsidian, but due to the change, the files opened with the new version of the plugin won't open with an older version of the plugin anymore.
