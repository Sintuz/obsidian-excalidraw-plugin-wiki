## New and fixes from Excalidraw.com
- New text paste behavior. Pasting multiline text will generate separate text elements unless you hold down the shift button while pasting [#5786](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5786)
- line editor fixes [#5927](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5927)

## Fixed
- The Command Palette "Insert link" action now inserts the new link at the top drawing layer, not at the bottom.
- Updated, hopefully, better organized, Plugin Readme.

## New
- Second attempt at moving to React 18. This upgrade is required to maintain alignment with the core Excalidraw product and to continue to benefit from Excalidraw.com enhancements.
- Added options to Plugin Settings
  - to disable autozoom when loading a drawing for the first time [#907](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/907)
  - to modify autosave interval. You can now set an autosave interval for desktop and for mobile [#888](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/888)

## New in Excalidraw Automate
- Published the obsidian_module on the ExcalidrawAutomate object. `ExcalidrawAutomate.obsidian`. Publishing this object will give script developers increased flexibility and control over script automation.
