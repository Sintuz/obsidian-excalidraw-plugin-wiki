## Minor QoL improvements
- When you open a second drawing in the same Excalidraw view (i.e. by navigating a link) and make a change to this drawing, and then press UNDO, the entire drawing disappeared. Redo brought the image back, however, this behavior was frustrating. Not anymore...
- On iPad
  - when you open the command palette, autozoom resized the drawing. If the Obsidian command palette or some other modal window is shown Excalidraw will not resize the view.
  - when you add a link to the drawing using the Command Palette, sometimes the link was added in a far corner of the drawing outside the current view area. This should be fixed now.

# Excalidraw Automate
I added the following function to Excalidraw Automate. This allows you to position new items based on the last known pointer position on the canvas.
```typescript
public getViewLastPointerPosition(): {x:number, y:number};
```
