  - Activate using the Obsidian tools panel, the Obsidian Command Palette, or the Alt+F11 shortcut
  - The ESC key no longer closes full-screen
  - Full-screen mode works properly on iOS as well

## Fixed
- The [deconstruct selected elements into a new drawing](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Deconstruct%20selected%20elements%20into%20new%20drawing.md) script now also correctly decomposes transcluded text elements.
