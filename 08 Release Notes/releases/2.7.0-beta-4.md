Fixed LaTeX Race Condition in 2.7.0-beta-3 (causing multiple instances of MathJax to be potentially loaded into memory).

## QoL Fixes
- Embeddable file editing does not get interrupted unexpectedly
- Hover preview does not show for back-of-the-note cards as it is distracting.

## QoL New
- Excalidraw will default to the last pen mode when switching between drawings within the same session. Thus if you used the pen on the previous drawing, pen mode will be active in the next drawing you open.
