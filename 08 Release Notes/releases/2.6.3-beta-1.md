## Fixed
- text wrapping fix trailing line whitespaces layout shift [#8714](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8714)
- Reset aspect ratio and set to 100% of original size command palette actions will now work correctly with cropped images
- Cropping Excalidraw drawings, then changing the cropped drawing will now work, albeit it is impossible to come up with an intelligent algorithm to maintain the right crop location. For this purpose I recommend the area, group, frame links.

## Refactoring
- Excalidraw.com made further changes to font loading. Hopefully these will have no unexpected impact in Obsidian [#8693](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8693) 
- Text wrapping [#8715](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8715)
