## Fixed
- Frame transclusion not working when there is a LaTeX equation anywhere in the scene. [#2028](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2028)
- Frame settings and rounded image corners not honored when exporting (and auto exporting) SVG. [#2026](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2026)
- Arrow label links did not work. Because CTRL/CMD+Click is Excalidraw's approach for starting the line editor, the solution is not as simple from a UX perspective [#2023](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2023)
  - You can open arrow links if you ctrl+click on the label itself, or if the arrow or line element has the link, then ctrl click on the link indicator in the top right.
  - You can also open the link by right clicking on the linear element and selecting open link from the context menu.
- Various elbow-arrow fixes and QoL improvements from excalidraw.com [#8324](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8324), [#8448](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8448), [#8440](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8440)

## New
- Flip arrow heads. If you have an arrow that is bound to elements, if you only select the arrow, and not the bound elements and press SHIFT+H or SHIFT+V the arrow heads will be swapped. [#8525](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8525)
