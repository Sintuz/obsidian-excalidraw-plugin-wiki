This version includes the code for the new canvas element linking feature from Excalidraw.com... however, in Obsidian this feature is hidden since it was already solved long ago, and the solution from excalidraw.com would introduce additional UX complexity (and would also not work in Obsidian because of the different architecture in Obsidian compared to the web).  I hope this new feature in the code will have no impact (has not created new bugs) in the Obsidian plugin... This will require careful testing over the next few days to verify).

## New
- Diagnostics to analyze startup time. After Obsidian has loaded open Developer Console (CTRL+SHIFT+i / CMD+OPT+i) and type the following `ExcalidrawAutomate.printStartupBreakdown()`

## Fixed
- BUG: icon on the ribbon menu keeps reappearing even if you hide it every time you reopen Obsidian [#2115](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2115)
- In pen mode, when single-finger panning is enabled, allow actions with the mouse.
- When editing an Excalidraw file in split mode (drawing on one side, markdown view on the other), editing the markdown sometimes causes the drawing to re-zoom and jump away from the selected area.
