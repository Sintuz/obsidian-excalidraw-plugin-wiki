## Fixed
- text sizing issue in the drawing first loaded after Obsidian restart [#2086](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2086)
- Excalidraw fails to load if Excalidraw folder includes a file with a filename starting with the same character sequence as the scripts folder. e.g. Script Folder is `Excalidraw/Scripts` and the `Excalidraw` folder has a file called `Scripts-whatever.md` [#2095](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2095)
