- File loading error [#1062](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1062)
- Embedded images in markdown documents no longer have the line on the side. Image sizing works better. [#1059](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1059)
- Locked elements will not show a hover preview [#1060](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1060)
- CTRL/CMD + K correctly triggers add link [#1056](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1056)

## New
- Grid color adjusts to the view background color
