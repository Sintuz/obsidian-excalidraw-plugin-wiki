## New
- If you create a Text Element that includes only a transclusion e.g.: `![[My Image.png]]` excalidraw will automatically replace the transclusion with the embedded image. [#1243](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1243)
- New Excalidraw splash screen icon contributed by Felix H√§berle. üòç

## Fixed
- Popout windows behaved inconsistently losing focus at the time when a markdown file was embedded. Hopefully, this is now working as intended.
- A number of small fixes that will also improve the ExcaliBrain experience
