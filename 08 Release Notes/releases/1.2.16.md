## Fixes
- On rare occasions, when [closing Obsidian](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/caee4f7500ba375e181e67f97e0682369a5e770a/src/main.ts#L896) with an Excalidraw file open, syncing the drawing with the underlying markdown before saving was in a race condition that resulted in an invalid JSON. I moved [this code](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/6d285466773e40e6dafd98f5e5715b39c0aab209/src/ExcalidrawView.ts#L167) into an [await block](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/caee4f7500ba375e181e67f97e0682369a5e770a/src/ExcalidrawView.ts#L159)
- Changed fullscreen mode, to be even more fullscreen
- Hover preview did not show in fullscreen mode, I added an [ugly workaround](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/caee4f7500ba375e181e67f97e0682369a5e770a/src/ExcalidrawView.ts#L765), for now, to reattach the popover to the contentEl, because in fullscreen mode only the contentEl is visible, other DIVs are hidden.
- Changed how image updates happen after settings changes. Moved reloadRequests and embedUpdates to settings.hide().

# New feature
- Added setting to have a different prefix for URL links.
- Added a new frontmatter switch for document-specific URL prefix.
