## New Feature
Added a new function to ExcalidrawAutomate: `ExcalidrawAutomate.viewToggleFullScreen()` will change target view between normal and fullscreen mode. Only supports Obsidian desktop. The function will do nothing on mobile.
```javascript
ea = ExcalidrawAutomate;
ea.setView("first");
ea.viewToggleFullScreen();
```
