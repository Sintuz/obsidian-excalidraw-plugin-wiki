## Fixed
- Script Engine only looked at the basename of script-file when creating the command palette ID, as a result, if the same filename was present in multiple folders, only one of them (unpredictable which one) showed in the command palette.
- Deployed Excalidraw core product: fix: Reduce padding to 5px for bounded text [#4530](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/4530)

# New Feature
- Implemented checking for available updates on GitHub for installed scripts
