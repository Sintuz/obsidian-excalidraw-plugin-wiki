## Fix:
- [#130](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/130) Markdown loses focus in side by side mode

# Changed feature:
- [#121](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/121) and [#129](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/129) 
Command Palette `Create a new drawing - IN A NEW PANE - and embed into active document` and `Create a new drawing - IN THE CURRENT ACTIVE PANE - and embed into active document` will use the Vault's `Default location for new attachments` setting + the filename of the active file + "_" + Excalidraw's filename date setting for the filename of the new drawing.
- Excalidraw will now process `![[drawing.md|100%|css-class]]` correctly. The width of the drawing in the resulting HTML will correctly show 100%. This feature is useful when including Excalidraw images into presentations with the Slides core plugin.
