## New
- Created a new **Fonts** section in settings. Downloading CJK fonts locally takes a few steps, but it works properly even when Obsidian does not have Internet access.
- Added an option under **Appearance and Behavior / Link Click** to disable double-click link navigation in view mode. [#2075](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2075)
