## Fixed
- Dynamic styling did not pick up correctly
  - the accent color with the default Obsidian theme
  - the drawing theme color with the out-of-the-box, default new drawing (not using a template)
- The Obsidian tools panel did not pick up user scripts when installing your very first script. A reload of Obsidian was required.
