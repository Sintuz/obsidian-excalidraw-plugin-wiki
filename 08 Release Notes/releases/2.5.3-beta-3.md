This should be the same as 2.5.3-beta-2 with one new feature (see below). However, Excalidraw moved many files around, and renamed files... hopefully, I found all changes and this works as before (or better ðŸ˜‰)

## New
- SVG export strictly only includes glyphs from fonts that are used in the drawing [#8678](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/8678)
