## Fixed
- In some situations Excalidraw hangs indefinitely when opening a different file in the same tab
- Can't exit arrow tool on phone [#2006](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2006)
- Save is triggered every few seconds, leading to glitches in handwriting [#2004](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2004)
- Canvas shifts when editing text reaches right hand side of the canvas, especially at higher zoom values
- Minor styling tweaks to adapt to Obsidian 1.7.1 new stylesheet, in particular to scale Excalidraw properly in line with Obsidian Appearance Setting Font-Size value.
- Tweaked Compatibilty Setting description to mention Obsidian 1.7.1 Footnotes support
