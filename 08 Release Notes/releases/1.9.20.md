## New
- Now you can insert [Mermaid](https://mermaid.live/) diagrams as Excalidraw elements into your drawings (currently only the [Flowchart](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html) type is supported, [other diagram types](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/#diagram-types) are inserted as Mermaid native images. 
  - ⚠️**This feature requires Obsidian API v1.4.14 (the latest desktop version). On Obsidian mobile API v1.4.14 is only available to Obsidian insiders currently**
  - If you want to contribute to the project please head over to [mermaid-to-excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/mermaid-to-excalidraw) and help create the converters for the other diagram types as well.
- The Fourth Font now also supports the OTF format
- Disable snap-to-grid in grid mode by holding down the CTRL/CMD while drawing or moving an element [#6983](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6983)
- I updated the Excalidraw logo in Obsidian. This affects the logo on the tab and the ribbon.

## New from excalidraw.com
- Elements alignment snapping. Hold down the CTRL/CMD button while moving an element to snap it to other objects. [#6256](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6256)

## New in the script library
- Shape [Boolean Operations](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Boolean%20Operations.md) script in script library 🙏@GColoy

## Fixed
- Fourth Font displays correctly in SVG embeds mode
- The re-colorMap map (see [1.9.19](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/releases/tag/1.9.19) for more info) did not work when either of the fill or stroke color properties of the image was missing.

## New in Excalidraw Automate
- `getPolyBool()` returns a [PolyBool](https://github.com/velipso/polybooljs) object
- sample mermaid code:
```js
ea = ExcalidrawAutomate();
ea.setView();
await ea.addMermaid(
  `flowchart TD
    A[Christmas] -->|Get money| B(Go shopping)
    B --> C{Let me think}
    C -->|One| D[Laptop]
    C -->|Two| E[iPhone]
    C -->|Three| F[fa:fa-car Car]`
);
ea.addElementsToView();
```
