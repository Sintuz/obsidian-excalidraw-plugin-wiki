## New from Excalidraw.com
- Improved handling of arrows and lines. ([#5501](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5501))

# Fixed
- When opening a document in view-mode or zen-mode the panel buttons no longer flash up for a moment before switching to the desired mode. ([#479](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/479))
- The "blinding white screen" no longer flashes up while loading the scene if the scene is dark ([#241](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/241))

# Under the hood
- Finalized migration to React 18 (no longer showing an error about React 17 compatibility mode in console log)
