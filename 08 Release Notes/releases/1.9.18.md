## New
- Excalidraw now syncs with Obsidian's language settings, provided translations are available. [#1297](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1297)

## Fixed
- [#1285](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1285): Solved Obsidian crashes caused by copying images from Excalidraw into markdown notes. Going forward:
  - Copying an image will paste its embed link,
  - Copying a text element will paste the text,
  - For all other elements with links, the link will be pasted.
  - In all other cases nothing will be pasted.
  
- Resolved grid instability ([#1298](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1298)).
- Fixed missing `[[square brackets]]` in PDF section references, making the links functional.
- Corrected the behavior of "Open current link in browser" for embedded YouTube and Vimeo frames. Clicking the globe button will now correctly open the links.
