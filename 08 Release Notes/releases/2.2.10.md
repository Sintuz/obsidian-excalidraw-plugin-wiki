[![Thumbnail - 20240721 Image references for embedded images (Custom)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44c020d6-fdaf-4b01-9003-7ff589077827)](https://youtu.be/sjZfdqpxqsg)

## Fixed
- Drastically degraded rendering performance when zoomed in and when arrows with labels are used. [#8267](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8267), [#8266](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8266), , [#1893](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1893)
- Frame title font in exports. 

## New
- Area, Group, Frame, and Clipped-Frame references to images now also work when pasting images to Excalidraw.
- The new reference type `clippedframe=` works in the same way as `frame=` but will display the elements clipped by the frame. `clippedframe=` will always display the image with zero padding.
- New command palette action: `Frame Settings` gives you fine-grained control over how frames are rendered. Frame settings will also be reflected in image exports. For example, if you hide the frame name or outline, then in exports they will not be visible.
