## Fixed
- [#376](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/376) : text alignment of stick notes in markdown embeds got lost. Not any more
- I changed the ScriptEngine suggester limit to 20. This will improve speed in the case of large datasets.
- Jumping text ([#4630](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/4630))
- The popover context menu displays partially offscreen ([#4631](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/4631))

# New 
- Updated Chinese translation (PR [#379](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/379), thank you @tswwe)
- [#350](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/350) Filename settings for embed drawings. Added new setting, toggle button: Name of the new inserted drawing starts with the name of the note.

- [#373](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/373) New setting to specify if embedded drawing should be created in the Excalidraw folder or the attachments folder specified in Obsidian settings

- New ExcalidrawAutomate functions
```typescript
//Open a file in a new workspace leaf or reuse an existing adjacent leaf depending on Excalidraw Plugin Settings
openFileInNewOrAdjacentLeaf (file:TFile):WorkspaceLeaf;

//measure text size based on current style settings
measureText(text:string):{ width: number, height: number };

//returns true if plugin version is >= than required
verifyMinimumPluginVersion(requiredVersion: string):boolean; 
```
