## New Feature
- I added a very rudimentary solution to support copy/paste of images and equations between drawings. Normally images and equations are stored as images, and when you paste them to another drawing, a new copy of the image would be created. Even worst, the pasted version of the equation will no longer link to a formula but will become a pasted PNG image file. The solution I implemented now, keeps track of all the images and equations that were open in Excalidraw during your current Obsidian session. When you paste an image or equation, the plugin will check for the fileId within your current session, and if a match is found, it will paste the formula or the image location, instead of the bitmap. I could at a later time index the whole vault for formulas and embedded images, but that feels very resource-intensive. I believe the current solution will be fit for purpose, discounting some edge cases of copying between vaults. Note that even though Excalidraw.com does not support LaTeX, if you copy/paste an equation from Obsidian to Excalidraw.com and then copy/paste it back to Obsidian (while within the same Obsidian session), the equation will convert back from a bitmap into an equation.
