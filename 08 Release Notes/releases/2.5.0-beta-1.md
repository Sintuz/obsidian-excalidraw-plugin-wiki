## New
- Canvas Search from excalidraw.com (CTRL/CMD+F). The "old" search is still available on the command palette "Search for text in drawing". The old search will also search in file names and frame titles, but the result set is not as sophisticated as the one built by Excalidraw.com. If you want to use the old search you can set up a hotkey in Obsidian settings, e.g. CTRL+ALT/CMD+OPT + F.
## Fixed
- Significantly improved the performance of image embeds for group and frame references when the source drawing includes many images.
