## Warning
This is a pre-release using the latest unreleased Excalidraw 0.7.0 package. Based on my testing experience, this is stable, but not production-ready until Excalidraw 0.7.0 is officially released. 

## Fixes
Excalidraw 0.7.0 fixes two bugs that affected the usability of Excalidraw in Obsidian, namely:
- The keyboard event propagation issue that impacted other workspace leaves in Obsidian. See bugs [#11](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/11) and [#12](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/12).
- The issue with placing library items outside view. 

The positioning of the drawing is also fixed. Drawings should now always appear centered within the workspace canvas when opening.

## Breaking change
Excalidraw 0.7.0 also introduces a breaking change in how client-side stencil libraries are handled. As a consequence items in your stencil library (But not the drawings saved in your vault!) will be lost. You will need to add library items again.

## To Install:
