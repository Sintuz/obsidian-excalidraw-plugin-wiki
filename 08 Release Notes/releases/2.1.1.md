## Fixed
- Printing a markdown page that has an Excalidraw drawing on the back side, resulted in an empty PDF. This is now resolved.

## New
- Reduce the visual clutter by fading out the Excalidraw markup in markdown view mode. This feature needs to be enabled in plugin settings. You'll find the setting under `Miscellaneous features`. Look for `Fade out Excalidraw markup`. Depending on the location of the markdown comment `%%`, if the comment starts before `# Text Elements` then the fading will start from `# Text Elements`, if the comment is before `# Drawing` then the fading will only start with "drawing". If you delete the opening `%%` the markup will be visible. Note, that if you place the comment before `#Text Elements`, you will not be able to reference blocks in the `# Text Elements` section, because Obsidian does not index blocks within comment blocks. Image references are not effective, they will work.
