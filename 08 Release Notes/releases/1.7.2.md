Due to some of the changes to the code, I highly recommend restarting Obsidian after installing this update to Excalidraw.

# Fixed
- Stability improvements
- Opening links in new panes and creating new drawings from the file explorer works properly again

# New feature
- Two new command palette actions:
  - Create a new drawing - IN A POPOUT WINDOW
  - Create a new drawing - IN A POPOUT WINDOW - and embed into active document

- Added setting to prefer opening the link in the popout window or in the main workspace.
