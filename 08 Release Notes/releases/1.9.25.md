## Fixed
- Fixed issues with creating Markdown or Excalidraw files for non-existing documents [#1385](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1385)
- Resolved a bug where changing the section/block filter after duplicating a markdown embeddable now works correctly on the first attempt [#1387](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1387)

## New
- Easily create a markdown file and embed it as an embedded frame with a single click when clicking a link pointing to a non-existent file.
