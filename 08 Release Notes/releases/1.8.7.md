- removed the white background when editing arrow-label [#6033](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6033)
- Minor style tweaks
  - for embedding Excalidraw into Obsidian Canvas. e.g. dragging no longer accidentally creates an image copy of the drawing, and
  - style tweaks on the Excalidraw canvas

## New
- If you set a different text color and sticky note stroke color, now if you change the sticky note border color, the text color will not be changed.
