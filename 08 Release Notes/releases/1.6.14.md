# New Feature
- Search for text elements in the scene. The script will select matching text elements and will zoom the scene to these elements. Use "quotation marks" to search for an exact match. Search is case insensitive and also ignores linebreaks.

- Updated the [Change shape of selected elements](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Change%20shape%20of%20selected%20elements.md) script to convert lines and arrows as well. If the selection includes both "line" type elements and "box" type elements, then the user will be prompted first to convert boxed elements to rectangle, diamond, or ellipse, and then to convert line type elements to line or arrow.
- [#457](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/457) New option in Excalidraw settings to embed link to Excalidraw SVG or PNG as markdown link or Wiki link.
