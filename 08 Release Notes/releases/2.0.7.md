# Fixed
- Android and iOS crash. I can't apologize enough for releasing a version that I did not properly test on Android and iOS ðŸ˜°. That ought to teach me something about last-minute changes before hitting release.
- Scaled-resizing a sticky note (SHIFT+resize) caused Excalidraw to choke on slower devices
- Improved plugin performance focusing on minimizing Excalidraw's effect on Obsidian overall
- Images embedded with a URL often did not show up in image exports, hopefully, the issue will less frequently occur in the future.
- Local file URL now follows Obsidian standard - making it easier to navigate in Markdown view mode.

# New
- Bonus feature compared to 2.0.5: Second-order links when clicking embedded images. I use images to connect ideas. Clicking on an image and seeing all the connections immediately is very powerful.
- In plugin settings, under "Startup Script", the button now opens the startup script if it already exists.
- Partial support for animated GIFs (will not show up in image exports, but can be added as interactive embeddables)
- Configurable modifier keys for link click action and drag&drop actions
- Improved support for drag & drop from your local drive and embedding of files external to Excalidraw.
