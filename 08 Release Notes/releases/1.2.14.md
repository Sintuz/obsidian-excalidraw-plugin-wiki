## New feature
Added feature to select if SVG or PNG images are rendered in Markdown Preview. PNG images will be scaled depending on the embed size, to avoid image quality issues with PNG. The new feature is linked to [Excalidraw issue #3910](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/3910).

# Fixes
In the case of complex drawings, the hover preview was displayed extremely slowly. On less powerful PCs Obsidian appeared to freeze for minutes. The root cause of the issue was found to be the markdown preview of extremely large code blocks (of over several hundreds of KBs). The drawing section of Excalidraw markdown files is now placed within markdown comments `%%` blocking preview from picking up these code blocks. The fix does not include automatic patching of all existing drawings. Drawings will get migrated to the new commented format as they are opened and edited. Migrated drawings will display quickly in hover preview.
