## New from Excalidraw.com
- support segment midpoints in line editor [#5641](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5641)

# Fixed
- When editing a line or arrow and selecting a tool on the toolbar, the tool jumps back to the selection tool and you need to click again to select the tool [#5703](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/5703)
- Minor improvement of autosave, hopefully decreasing occasional lagging
