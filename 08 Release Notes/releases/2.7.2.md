## Fixed
- The plugin did not load on **iOS 16 and older**. [#2170](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2170)
- Added empty line between `# Excalidraw Data` and `## Text Elements`. This will now follow **correct markdown linting**. [#2168](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2168)
- Adding an **embeddable** to view did not **honor the element background and element stroke colors**, even if it was configured in plugin settings. [#2172](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2172)
- **Deconstruct selected elements script** did not copy URLs and URIs for images embedded from outside Obsidian. Please update your script from the script library. 
- When **rearranging tabs in Obsidian**, e.g. having two tabs side by side, and moving one of them to another location, if the tab was an Excalidraw tab, it appeared as non-responsive after the move, until the tab was resized.

## Source Code Refactoring
- Updated filenames, file locations, and file name letter-casing across the project
- Extracted onDrop, onDragover, etc. handlers to DropManger in ExcalidrawView
