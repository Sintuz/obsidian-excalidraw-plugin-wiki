## Fixed
- Under some special circumstances an Excalidraw drawing embedded into another Excalidraw drawing did not update when you modified the embedded drawing until you closed Excalidraw completely and reopened it. [#637](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/637)

# New
- ExcalidrawAutomate addLabelToLine adds a text label to a line or arrow. Currently only works with a simple straight 2-point (start & end) lines.
```typescript
addLabelToLine(lineId: string, label: string): string
```
- ExcalidrawAutomate ConnectObjects now returns the id of the arrow that was created.
