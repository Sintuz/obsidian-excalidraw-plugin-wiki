## fixed
- Excalidraw canvas is empty after saving the drawing and re-opening it at a later time. If you accidentally paste Excalidraw elements from the clipboard as the contents of a text element, in certain situations this can corrupt the Excalidraw file and as a result, Excalidraw will load an empty-looking drawing the next time.  Changing to markdown view, these files can be repaired, however, to avoid accidental data loss, I have prevented pasting of excalidraw clipboard contents as text elements.
