## Fixed
- Deleting excalidraw file from file system while it is open in fullscreen mode in Obsidian causes Obsidian to be stuck in full-screen view [#2161](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2161)
- Chinese fonts are not rendered in LaTeX statements [#2162](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2162)
- Since Electron 32 (newer Obsidian Desktop installers) drag and drop links from Finder or OS File Explorer did not work. [Electron breaking change](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/breaking-changes#removed-filepath). This is now fixed
- Addressed unnecessary image reloads when changing windows in Obsidian
