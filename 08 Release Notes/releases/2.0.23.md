## New in ExcalidrawAutomate
- Excalidraw Publish Support: New hook to modify the link in the exported SVGs. This is useful when you want to export SVGs to your website. If set, this callback is triggered whenever a drawing is exported to SVG. The string returned by the hook will replace the link in the exported SVG. The hook is only executed if the link is to a file internal to Obsidian. [1605](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1605)
```js
onUpdateElementLinkForExportHook: (data: {
*    originalLink: string,
*    obsidianLink: string,
*    linkedFile: TFile | null,
*    hostFile: TFile,
*  }) => string = null;
```
