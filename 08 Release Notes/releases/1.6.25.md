## Fixed
- pinch-zoom in view mode ([#5001](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5001))
- add image button on iPad was not working ([#5038](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5038) & [#584](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/584))

## New Feature
- If Excalidraw is open in a [hover-editor](https://github.com/nothingislost/obsidian-hover-editor) window when opening a link in a new pane by CTRL+SHIFT clicking on the link, Excalidraw will open the link in the main workspace and not by splitting the view inside the hover-editor. 
- Excalidraw ScriptEngine settings
  - Script Engine settings now render HTML descriptions
  - If `height` property of a text setting is set, the setting text input will be rendered as a textArea with the specified height.
