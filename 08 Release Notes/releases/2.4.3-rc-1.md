## Fixed
- In some situations Excalidraw hangs indefinitely when opening a different file in the same tab
- Can't exit arrow tool on phone [#2006[(https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2006)
- Save is triggered every few seconds, leading to glitches in handwriting [#2004](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2004)
- Canvas shifts when editing text reaches right hand side of the canvas, especially at higher zoom values
