Minor fixes:
- In certain cases when an image was permanently deleted from Obsidian and from Excalidraw automate, Excalidraw would not recognize the change until Obsidian was restarted.
- Container bound text elements (sticky notes), the TextElement will inherit the group bindings of the parent container.
