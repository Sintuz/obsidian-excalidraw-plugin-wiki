## Fixed
- Text height becomes unreadable after 2.2.0 update. [#1784](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1784)
- Images are loaded with a rounded border when loading old Excalidraw files
- Embedded Excalidraw images cache gets stuck with old version of the image
- Extremely long loading times with legacy (3+ years old) Excalidraw files
