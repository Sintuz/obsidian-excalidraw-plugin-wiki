## Fixed
- Tool buttons did not visually stick the first time you clicked them.
- Tray (in tray mode) was higher when the help button was visible. The tray in tablet mode was too large and the help button was missing.
- ExcalidrawAutomate `getCM(color:TInput): ColorMaster;` function will now properly convert valid [css color names](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp) to ColorMaster objects.
- The downloaded script icons in the Excalidraw-Obsidian menu were not always correct
- The obsidian mobile navigation bar at the bottom overlapped with Excalidraw

# New
- Created ExcalidrawAutomate hook for styling script when the canvas color changes. See sample [onCanvasColorChangeHook](https://gist.github.com/zsviczian/c7223c5b4af30d5c88a0cae05300305c) implementation following the link.

```typescript
  /**
   * If set, this callback is triggered whenever the active canvas color changes
   */
  onCanvasColorChangeHook: (
    ea: ExcalidrawAutomate,
    view: ExcalidrawView, //the Excalidraw view 
    color: string,
  ) => void = null;
