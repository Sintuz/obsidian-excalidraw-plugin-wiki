Fix:
- Forcing the embedded image to always scale to 100% (a feature introduced in [1.7.26](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/releases/tag/1.7.26)) scaled the embedded excalidraw drawings incorrectly on devices with a pixel ratio of 2 or 3 (e.g. iPads). This is now fixed, however, this fix might retrospectively impact drawings that use this feature. Sorry for that.
