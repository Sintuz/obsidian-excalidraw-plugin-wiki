## Refactor
- Moved MathJax (LaTeX equation SVG image generation) package to load only on demand; and compressed the mathjax package in the plugin file. This aims to counterbalance the increase in size due to the inclusion of mermaid diagrams package in Excalidraw and the consequent startup performance hit.

## Fixed
- Addressed multiple fuzziness with embeddable appearance settings and edit mode on/off switching when single click editing is enabled in settings.
