## Fixed
- Image cropping now supports dark mode
- Image cropping/carve-out was not working reliably in some cases [#1546](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1546)
- Masking a mirrored image resulted in an off-positioned mask

## New
- Context menu action to convert SVG to Excalidraw strokes
- Updated Chinese translation (Thank you @tswwe)
