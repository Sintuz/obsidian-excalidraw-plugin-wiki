## New
- Stylus button now activates the eraser function. Note: This feature is supported for styluses that comply with industry-standard button events. Unfortunately, Samsung SPEN and Apple Pencil do not support this functionality.

## Fixed
- Improved handwriting quality. I have resolved the long-standing issue of closing the loop when ends of the line are close, making an "u" into an "o" ([#1529](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1529) and [#6303](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/6303)).
- Improved Excalidraw's full-screen mode behavior. Access it via the Obsidian Command Palette or the full-screen button on the Obsidian Tools Panel ([#1528](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1528)).
- Fixed color picker overlapping with the Obsidian mobile toolbar on Obsidian-Mobile.
- Corrected display issues with alternative font sizes (Fibonacci and Zoom relative) in the element properties panel when editing a text element (refer to [2.0.11 Release Notes](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/releases/tag/2.0.11) for details about the font-size Easter Egg).
- Resolved the issue where Excalidraw SVG exports containing LaTeX were not loading correctly into Inkscape ([#1519](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/pull/1519)). Thanks to üôè@HyunggyuJang for the contribution.
