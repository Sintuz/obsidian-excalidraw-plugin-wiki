## Fixed & Improved
- Fixed an issue where the toolbar lost focus, requiring two clicks. This caused a problem when the hand tool was activated from ExcalidrawAutomate script when opening a drawing, causing buttons to stop working. [#1344](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1344)
- Resolved a caching issue affecting image area-links and group-links, making them work inconsistently. For more details, refer to the discussion on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1026825302900494357/1169311900308361318).
- Improved frame colors with Dynamic Coloring.
- Added support for multiline LaTeX formulas. [#1403](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1403)
- Fixed the issue of Chinese characters overlapping in MathJax. [#1406](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1406)

## New
- Added support for Mermaid to Excalidraw **Sequence Diagrams**.
- If an image contains an element link, clicking on the image will now open the link chooser, allowing you to decide whether to open the image or follow the element link.
- When hovering over an image that also has an element link, the hover preview will display the contents of the link.
- You can now choose to **import PDFs** in columns instead of rows. Additionally, you have the option to group all pages after import, which will improve the unlocking experience if you also lock pages on import.
- Introduced configuration options for the **Laser Tool**, including pointer color, decay length, and time. ([#1408](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1408), [#1220](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1220))
