## Fixed
- Mermaid to Excalidraw stopped working after installing the Obsidian 1.5.0 insider build. [#1450](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1450)
- Embed color settings were not honored when the embedded markdown was focused on a section or block.
- CTRL+Click on a Mermaid diagram did not open the Mermaid editor.
- Scrollbars were visible when the embeddable was set to transparent (set background color to match element background, and set element background color to "transparent").
