This is an early beta experiment to see how I could display Excalidraw images in the new 0.13.0 WYSIWYG editor. The solution is incomplete. While I don't think this will do any damage to existing drawings, I advise some caution. Best to install this version of excalidraw in a test vault for now.

Note: if you are referencing text elements in other documents using the block references in the .md file, those block references will not work with this update. I am working on a solution.
