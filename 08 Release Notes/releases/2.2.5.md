## Fixed
- Cursor visibility in dark mode [#1812](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1812)
- SVG to Excalidraw now...
  - converts elements inside the `<switch>` tag, improving compatibility with SVGs from [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/)
  - sets visibility for all elements, preventing invisible converted images.
- Cached images sometimes lost their font face and natural size when nested in an Excalidraw scene. This issue occurred when drawings were embedded in a markdown note (native SVG) and nested in a drawing simultaneously. Depending on the update and render sequence, these drawings sometimes appeared incorrectly in the Excalidraw scene.
