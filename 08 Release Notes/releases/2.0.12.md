## Fixed
- Stencil library not working [#1516](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1516), [#1517](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1517)
- The new convert image from URL to Local File feature did not work in two situations:
  - When the embedded image is downloaded from a very slow server (e.g. OpenAIs temp image server)
  - On Android
- The postToOpenAI function did not work in all situations on Android.
- ExcaliAI wireframe to code did not display correctly on Android
- Tooltips kept popping up on Android.

## New
- Added "Save image from URL to local file" to the right-click context menu
- Further ExcaliAI improvements including support for image editing with image mask
