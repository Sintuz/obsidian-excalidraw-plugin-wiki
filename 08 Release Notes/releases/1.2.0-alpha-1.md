I have released [Excalidraw 1.2.0 Alpha 2](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/releases/tag/1.2.0-alpha-2). Please review the release notes here, before downloading Alpha 2 following the link.

This release includes major changes and will require running the "Migrate to version 1.2" command palette script to migrate your existing drawings.

⚠⚠⚠ This is an alpha release. I did my best to test it and to make it stable, but... please make a backup of your data before installing this. In "theory" downgrade to 1.1.x is possible, but I haven't written a script for that! ⚠⚠⚠

__Excalidraw 1.2 integrates Excalidraw fully into Obsidian.__ The plugin no longer uses `*.excalidraw` files, instead, drawings are stored in `*.md` files, just like any other Obsidian document. 

# New and changed features
- I changed the file format from `*.excalidraw` to `*.md`
  - I removed Excalidraw Sync - no longer needed
  - Drawings now have full version history with Obsidian Sync
  - Because drawings are now markdown files, you can create as many templates as you want
- You'll find commands to switch between Markdown and Excalidraw view in the Options menu.
- Text Elements from the drawing are synchronized with block references into the underlying markdown document. This opens up LOTS OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES.
  - Links in Excalidraw now support Aliases i.e `[[link|Alias]]`
  - Links in drawings will show up in backlinks of documents
  - Transclusions are supported i.e. `![[myfile#^blockref]]` will convert in the drawing into the transcluded text
  - Using the block reference you can also reference & transclude text that appears on drawings, in other documents
  - You can add tags to drawings
  - You can add metadata to the YAML front matter of drawings
  - Anything you add between the frontmatter and the `# Text Elements` heading will be ignored by Excalidraw, i.e. you can add whatever you like here, it will be preserved as part of the document.
  - Excalidraw documents now show in graph view.
- To support transclusion and aliases, the canvas now has a Text Element lock. This lock changes the text from preview to edit. Use CTRL+SHIFT+E to quickly switch between text element preview and edit mode.
- I moved SVG and PNG export to the options menu. CTRL+menu will trigger the export of the file outside Obsidian.
- I added an options-menu command to export to `*.excalidraw` format for portability.
- Added [language support](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/tree/master/src/lang/locale). Contact me if you'd like to translate.
